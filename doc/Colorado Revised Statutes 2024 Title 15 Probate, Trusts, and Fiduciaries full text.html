trust as defined in section 4947 (a)(1) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of

Internal Revenue Code of 1986, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in
the governing instrument or in any other law of this state, and except as otherwise
provided by court decree entered on or after June 2, 1971, the following acts shall
be prohibited:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Engaging in any act of self-dealing, as defined in section 4941 (d) of the
federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which would give rise to any liability for
the tax imposed by section 4941 (a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986;</SPAN></P>

imposed by section 4944 (a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and</SPAN></P>

the tax imposed by section 4945 (a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</SPAN></P>

of 1986, with the consent of all the beneficiaries under the governing instrument,
may, without application to any court and either before or after the funding of such

(e), 664, 2055 (e), and 2522 (c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to
the extent applicable, by executing a written amendment to the trust for that
purpose. Consent shall not be required as to individual beneficiaries not living at the
time of amendment or as to charitable beneficiaries not named or not in existence
at the time of amendment. The possibility of beneficial interests arising after the
amendment of the governing instruments shall not defeat the ability to amend. In
the case of an individual beneficiary not competent to give consent, the consent of
such beneficiary's guardian or conservator, if any, or the consent of a guardian ad
litem appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction is treated as the consent of the
beneficiary. A copy of the proposed amendment, executed by the trustee and
consented to by all beneficiaries whose consent is required under this subsection
(3), must be delivered in person or by registered mail to the attorney general. The
attorney general may, within sixty days after such receipt, indicate by registered
mail to the trustee his or her specific objections to such proposed amendment, in
which event the provisions of subsection (4) of this section apply if he or she does
not withdraw his or her objections. In the case of any amendment to a trust created

upon petition of the trustee or any beneficiary and upon a subsequent finding by
the court that the testator's or the grantor's intention would not be defeated by
such amendment. A copy of such petition shall be delivered in person or by
registered mail to the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

trustee or any other person shall be made only to organizations and for purposes

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>15-1.2-201.  Fiduciary duties - general principles. </STRONG>(1)  In making an allocation
or determination or exercising discretion under this article 1.2, a fiduciary shall:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Act in good faith, based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Administer a trust or estate impartially, except to the extent the terms of
the trust manifest an intent that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more
beneficiaries;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  A fiduciary's allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under
this article 1.2 is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary
may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the
terms of the trust, and an exercise of the power which produces a result different
from a result required or permitted by this article 1.2 does not create an inference
that the fiduciary abused the fiduciary's discretion.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  A fiduciary shall:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Add a receipt to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor
this article 1.2 allocates the receipt between income and principal; and</SPAN></P>

trust nor this article 1.2 allocates the disbursement between income and principal.</SPAN></P>

convert an income trust to a unitrust under section 15-1.2-303 (1)(a), change the

(1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under section 15-1.2-303 (1)(c), if the
fiduciary determines the exercise of the power will assist the fiduciary to
administer the trust or estate impartially.</SPAN></P>

determined by the fiduciary;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(h)  Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the fiduciary
power to accumulate income or invade principal or prohibit the fiduciary from

the financial interests of an estate, the court may, on its own motion or upon the
request of an interested person, without a hearing and without following any of the

restriction, or suspension of the powers of the fiduciary; direct the fiduciary to
appear before the court; or take such further action as the court deems appropriate
to protect the ward or protected person or the assets of the estate. If a court
restrains, restricts, or suspends the powers of a fiduciary, the court shall set a
hearing and direct that notice be given pursuant to section 15-10-505. The clerk of
the court shall immediately note the restraint, restriction, or suspension on the
fiduciary's letters, if any. Any action for the removal, surcharge, or sanction of a

it appears to the court that, in the absence of such an order, the fiduciary may take
some action that would unreasonably jeopardize the interest of the petitioner or of
some other interested person. The court may make persons with whom the fiduciary
may transact business parties to any order issued pursuant to this paragraph (b).

benefit of the decedent's estate or surviving spouse.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  Property transferred in any of the following forms by the decedent during
marriage:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Any irrevocable transfer in which the decedent retained the right to the

decedent's right related, to the extent that the fraction of the property passed
outside probate to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent's estate
or surviving spouse; or</SPAN></P>

conjunction with any other person or exercisable by a nonadverse party, for the
benefit of the decedent, the decedent's creditors, the decedent's estate, or the
creditors of the decedent's estate. The amount included with respect to a power
over property is the value of the property subject to the power, and the amount
included with respect to a power over income is the value of the property that
produces or produced the income, to the extent that the power in either case was
exercisable at the decedent's death to or for the benefit of any person other than
the decedent's surviving spouse or to the extent that the property subject to the
power passed at the decedent's death, by exercise, release, lapse, in default, or

subsection (2) of this section if the right, interest, or power had not terminated until
the decedent's death. The amount included is the value of the property that would
have been included under those provisions if the property were valued at the time
that the right, interest, or power terminated and is included only to the extent that
the property passed upon termination to or for the benefit of any person other than
the decedent or the decedent's estate, spouse, or surviving spouse. As used in this
subparagraph (I), termination, with respect to a right or an interest in property,
occurs when the right or interest terminates by the terms of the governing
instrument or the decedent transfers or relinquishes the right of interest and, with
respect to a power over property, when the power terminates by exercise, release,
lapse, in default, or otherwise; except that, with respect to a power described in

for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or other benefit to a

action in good-faith reliance on the validity of a governing instrument, upon request
and satisfactory proof of the decedent's death, before the payer or other third party
received written notice from the surviving spouse or the spouse's representative of
an intention to file a petition for the elective-share or that a petition for the
elective-share has been filed. A payer or other third party is liable for payments
made or other actions taken after the payer or other third party received written
notice of an intention to file a petition for the elective-share or that a petition for
the elective-share has been filed. Any form or service of notice other than that

proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been
commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating
to decedents' estates located in the county of the decedent's residence. The
availability of such actions under this section does not prevent the payer or other
third party from taking any other action authorized by law or the governing
instrument. The court is the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings
relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, the
court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents' estates
located in the county of the decedent's residence. If no probate proceedings have
been commenced, the payer or other third party shall file with the court a copy of
the written notice received by the payer or other third party, with the payment of
funds or transfer or deposit of property. The court shall not charge a filing fee to
the payer or other third party for the payment to the court of amounts owed or
transfer to or deposit with the court of any item of property even if no probate
proceedings have been commenced before such payment, transfer, or deposit.
Payment of amounts to the court or transfer to or deposit with the court of any item

recipient or against the funds or property on deposit with the court in the discretion
of the court. Payments or transfers to the court or deposits made into the court

in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Alternative devise means a devise that is expressly created by the will
and, under the terms of the will, can take effect instead of another devise on the
happening of one or more events, including survival of the testator or failure to
survive the testator, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent,
condition-subsequent, or any other form. A residuary clause constitutes an
alternative devise with respect to a nonresiduary devise only if the will specifically
provides that, upon lapse or failure, the nonresiduary devise, or nonresiduary
devises in general, pass under the residuary clause.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Class member includes an individual who fails to survive the testator
but who would have taken under a devise in the form of a class gift had he or she
survived the testator.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Devise includes an alternative devise, a devise in the form of a class
gift, and an exercise of a power of appointment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Devisee includes (i) a class member if the devise is in the form of a class
gift, (ii) the beneficiary of a trust but not the trustee, (iii) an individual or class
member who was deceased at the time the testator executed his or her will as well
as an individual or class member who was then living but who failed to survive the
testator, and (iv) an appointee under a power of appointment exercised by the
testator's will.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  (Reserved)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  Surviving devisee or surviving descendant means a devisee or a
descendant who neither predeceased the testator nor is deemed to have
predeceased the testator under section 15-11-702.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(g)  Testator includes the donee of a power of appointment if the power is
exercised in the testator's will.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  <STRONG>Substitute gift.</STRONG> If a devisee fails to survive the testator and is a
grandparent or a descendant of a grandparent of either the testator or the donor of
a power of appointment exercised by the testator's will, the following apply:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection (2), if the devise is
not in the form of a class gift and the deceased devisee leaves surviving
descendants, a substitute gift is created in the devisee's surviving descendants.
They take per capita at each generation the property to which the devisee would
have been entitled had the devisee survived the testator.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection (2), if the devise is
in the form of a class gift, other than a devise to issue, descendants, heirs of
the body, heirs, next of kin, relatives, or family, or a class described by
language of similar import, a substitute gift is created in the deceased devisee's or
devisees' surviving descendants. The property to which the devisees would have
been entitled had all of them survived the testator passes to the surviving devisees
and the surviving descendants of the deceased devisees. Each surviving devisee
takes the share to which he or she would have been entitled had the deceased
devisees survived the testator. Each deceased devisee's surviving descendants who
are substituted for the deceased devisee takes per capita at each generation the
share to which the deceased devisee would have been entitled had the deceased
devisee survived the testator. For the purposes of this paragraph (b), deceased
devisee means a class member who failed to survive the testator and left one or
more surviving descendants.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  For purposes of this part 6, words of survivorship, such as in a devise to
an individual if he survives me or in a devise to my surviving children, are not, in
the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to
the application of this section. The use of language such as and if he does not
survive me the gift shall lapse or to A and not to A's descendants shall be
sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  If the will creates an alternative devise with respect to a devise for which
a substitute gift is created by paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection (2), the
substitute gift is superseded by the alternative devise only if an expressly
designated devisee of the alternative devise is entitled to take under the will.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  Unless the language creating a power of appointment expressly excludes
the substitution of the descendants of an appointee for the appointee, a surviving
descendant of a deceased appointee of a power of appointment can be substituted
for the appointee under this section, whether or not the descendant is an object of
the power.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  <STRONG>Dispositions under separate writing.</STRONG> The provisions of this section shall
not apply to dispositions of tangible personal property made under section 15-11-513.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  <STRONG>More than one substitute gift; which one takes.</STRONG> If, under subsection (2)
of this section, substitute gifts are created and not superseded with respect to
more than one devise and the devises are alternative devises, one to the other, the
determination of which of the substitute gifts takes effect is resolved as follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection (4), the devised
property passes under the primary substitute gift.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  If there is a younger-generation devise, the devised property passes
under the younger-generation substitute gift and not under the primary substitute
gift.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  In this subsection (4):</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Primary devise means the devise that would have taken effect had all
the deceased devisees of the alternative devises who left surviving descendants
survived the testator.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Primary substitute gift means the substitute gift created with respect
to the primary devise.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  Younger-generation devise means a devise that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(A)  Is to a descendant of a devisee of the primary devise;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(B)  Is an alternative devise with respect to the primary devise;</SPAN></P>

a vehicle title as described in section 42-6-110.5. As used in this section, unless the
context otherwise requires:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Alternative beneficiary designation means a beneficiary designation
that is expressly created by the governing instrument and, under the terms of the
governing instrument, can take effect instead of another beneficiary designation on
the happening of one or more events, including survival of the decedent or failure to
survive the decedent, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent,
condition-subsequent, or any other form.</SPAN></P>

which the beneficiary must survive the decedent and includes (i) a class member if
the beneficiary designation is in the form of a class gift and (ii) an individual or class

the alternative beneficiary designation is entitled to take.</SPAN></P>

trust; substitute takers. </STRONG>(1)  <STRONG>Definitions.</STRONG> As used in this section, unless the context
otherwise requires:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Alternative future interest means an expressly created future interest
that can take effect in possession or enjoyment instead of another future interest
on the happening of one or more events, including survival of an event or failure to
survive an event, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or any other form. A residuary clause in a will does not create an
alternative future interest with respect to a future interest created in a
nonresiduary devise in the will, whether or not the will specifically provides that
lapsed or failed devises are to pass under the residuary clause.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Beneficiary means the beneficiary of a future interest and includes a
class member if the future interest is in the form of a class gift.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Class member includes an individual who fails to survive the distribution
date but who would have taken under a future interest in the form of a class gift
had he or she survived the distribution date.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Distribution date, with respect to a future interest, means the time
when the future interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment. The
distribution date need not occur at the beginning or end of a calendar day, but may
occur at a time during the course of a day.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  Future interest includes an alternative future interest and a future
interest in the form of a class gift.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  Future interest under the terms of a trust means a future interest that
was created by a transfer creating a trust or to an existing trust or by an exercise of
a power of appointment to an existing trust, directing the continuance of an
existing trust, designating a beneficiary of an existing trust, or creating a trust.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(g)  Surviving beneficiary or surviving descendant means a beneficiary or
a descendant who neither predeceased the distribution date nor is deemed to have
predeceased the distribution date under section 15-11-702.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  <STRONG>Survivorship required; substitute gift.</STRONG> A future interest under the terms
of a trust is contingent on the beneficiary's surviving the distribution date. If a
beneficiary of a future interest under the terms of a trust fails to survive the
distribution date, the following apply:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection (2), if the future
interest is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves
surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the beneficiary's surviving
descendants. They take per capita at each generation the property to which the
beneficiary would have been entitled had the beneficiary survived the distribution
date.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this subsection (2), if the future
interest is in the form of a class gift, other than a future interest to issue,
descendants, heirs of the body, heirs, next of kin, relatives, or family, or a
class described by language of similar import, a substitute gift is created in the
deceased beneficiary's or beneficiaries' surviving descendants. The property to
which the beneficiaries would have been entitled had all of them survived the
distribution date passes to the surviving beneficiaries and the surviving
descendants of the deceased beneficiaries. Each surviving beneficiary takes the
share to which he or she would have been entitled had the deceased beneficiaries
survived the distribution date. Each deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants
who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take per capita at each
generation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled
had the deceased beneficiary survived the distribution date. For the purposes of
this paragraph (b), deceased beneficiary means a class member who failed to
survive the distribution date and left one or more surviving descendants.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  For the purposes of this part 7, words of survivorship attached to a future
interest are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an
intent contrary to the application of this section. Words of survivorship include
words of survivorship that relate to the distribution date or to an earlier or an
unspecified time, whether those words of survivorship are expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent, or any other form.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  If a governing instrument creates an alternative future interest with
respect to a future interest for which a substitute gift is created by paragraph (a) or
(b) of this subsection (2), the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative future
interest only if an expressly designated beneficiary of the alternative future
interest is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  <STRONG>More than one substitute gift; which one takes.</STRONG> If, under subsection (2)
of this section, substitute gifts are created and not superseded with respect to
more than one future interest and the future interests are alternative future
interests, one to the other, the determination of which of the substitute gifts takes
effect is resolved as follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection (3), the property
passes under the primary substitute gift.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  If there is a younger-generation future interest, the property passes
under the younger-generation substitute gift and not under the primary substitute
gift.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  As used in this subsection (3), unless the context otherwise requires:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Primary future interest means the future interest that would have taken
effect had all the deceased beneficiaries of the alternative future interests who left
surviving descendants survived the distribution date.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Primary substitute gift means the substitute gift created with respect
to the primary future interest.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  Younger-generation future interest means a future interest that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(A)  Is to a descendant of a beneficiary of the primary future interest;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(B)  Is an alternative future interest with respect to the primary future
interest;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(C)  Is a future interest for which a substitute gift is created; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(D)  Would have taken effect had all the deceased beneficiaries who left
surviving descendants survived the distribution date except the deceased
beneficiary or beneficiaries of the primary future interest.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(IV)  Younger-generation substitute gift means the substitute gift created
with respect to the younger-generation future interest.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  <STRONG>If no other takers, property passes under residuary clause or to
transferor's heirs.</STRONG> Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, if, after the
application of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, there is no surviving taker, the
property passes in the following order:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  If the trust was created in a nonresiduary devise in the transferor's will or
in a codicil to the transferor's will, the property passes under the residuary clause in
the transferor's will; for purposes of this section, the residuary clause is treated as
creating a future interest under the terms of a trust.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  If no taker is produced by the application of paragraph (a) of this
subsection (4), the property passes to the transferor's heirs under section 15-11-711.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  <STRONG>If no other takers and if future interest created by exercise of power of
appointment.</STRONG> If, after the application of subsections (2) and (3) of this section,
there is no surviving taker and if the future interest was created by the exercise of a
power of appointment:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The property passes under the donor's gift-in-default clause, if any, which
clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  If no taker is produced by the application of paragraph (a) of this
subsection (5), the property passes as provided in subsection (4) of this section. For

power was a nongeneral power and means the donee if the power was a general
power.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  <STRONG>Per capita at each generation.</STRONG> If an applicable statute or a governing
instrument calls for property to be distributed per capita at each generation, the
property is divided into as many equal shares as there are (i) surviving descendants
in the generation nearest to the designated ancestor which contains one or more
surviving descendants and (ii) deceased descendants in the same generation who
left surviving descendants, if any. Each surviving descendant in the nearest
generation is allocated one share. The remaining shares, if any, are combined and

surviving children of the designated ancestor and (ii) deceased children who left
surviving descendants. Each surviving child, if any, is allocated one share. The share
of each deceased child with surviving descendants is divided in the same manner,

account to reduce the amount that the decedent's spouse or a qualifying trust is to
receive, only to the extent that the overall estate tax burden on the decedent's
estate is not thereby increased. However, if a preponderance of the evidence shows
that the decedent intended to increase the overall estate tax burden on the estate,
the state death tax credit shall be taken into account fully for the purposes of
reducing the amount that the decedent's spouse or a qualifying trust is to receive.
Any formula subject to construction under subsection (1) of this section is subject to
the presumption set forth in this subsection (3).</SPAN></P>

burden on the estate.</SPAN></P>

interest becomes irrevocable, or, if the interest arose under the law of intestate
succession, as of the time of the intestate's death.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The disclaimed interest passes according to any provision in the

it be disclaimed, or of disclaimed interests in general.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  If the instrument does not contain a provision described in paragraph (b)
of this subsection (2), the following rules apply:</SPAN></P>

the disclaimant had ceased to exist immediately before the time of distribution.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  If the disclaimant is an individual, except as otherwise provided for in
subparagraphs (III) and (IV) of this paragraph (c), the disclaimed interest passes as
if the disclaimant had died immediately before the time of distribution.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  If, by law or under the instrument, the descendants of the disclaimant
would share in the disclaimed interest by any method of representation had the
disclaimant died immediately before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest
passes only to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive the time of
distribution.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(IV) (A)  If the disclaimed interest would pass as part of the disclaimant's
estate had the disclaimant died immediately before the time of distribution, the
disclaimed interest instead passes as if by representation to the descendants of the
disclaimant who are living at the time of distribution.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(B)  If the disclaimed interest would pass as part of the disclaimant's estate
had the disclaimant died immediately before the time of distribution and no
descendant of the disclaimant survives the time of distribution, the disclaimed
interest passes to those persons, including the state to which such interest would
escheat, but excluding the disclaimant, and in such shares as such persons would
succeed to the transferor's intestate estate under the applicable law had the
transferor died at the time of distribution. However, for purposes of this sub-subparagraph (B), if the transferor's surviving spouse is living but remarried at the
time of distribution, the transferor is deemed to have died unmarried at the time of
distribution.</SPAN></P>

law refers to the intestate succession law of the transferor's domicile with respect
to a disclaimer of an interest in personal property and refers to the intestate
succession law of this state with respect to a disclaimed interest that is real
property located in this state.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(D)  In addition to other applications of this sub-subparagraph (D) that are
apparent, the general assembly declares its intent to have the rules of this sub-subparagraph (D) apply with respect to present interests in real property and
personal property that are transferred outright or in trust to an individual by a
transferor during the lifetime of the transferor where the interest disclaimed would,
if not disclaimed, have vested in the individual to whom the property is transferred
and would be part of that individual's estate if he or she had died immediately after
the transfer. Accordingly, this sub-subparagraph (D) shall be so construed to
determine the disposition of the present interest. For purposes of the application of
the rules to such present interests, the reference to immediately before the time
of distribution in sub-subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this subparagraph (IV) shall
instead be considered as references to immediately after the time of distribution.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(E)  In sub-subparagraph (D) of this subparagraph (IV), present interest

person other than the disclaimant takes effect as if the disclaimant had died or
ceased to exist immediately before the time of distribution, but a future interest
held by the disclaimant is not accelerated in possession or enjoyment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  An objection to an appointment can be made only in formal proceedings.
In case of objection the priorities stated in subsection (1) of this section apply,
except that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  If the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and
costs of administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims,
the court, on petition of creditors, may appoint any qualified person;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  In case of objection to appointment of a person, other than one whose
priority is determined by will, by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial
interest in the estate, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and
devisees whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than half of
the probable distributable value or, in default of this accord, any suitable person.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  A person entitled to letters under paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (1) of
this section and a person between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one who would
be entitled to letters but for his age may nominate a qualified person to act as
personal representative. Any person eighteen years of age or older may renounce
his right to nominate or to an appointment by appropriate writing filed with the
court. When two or more persons share a priority, those of them who do not
renounce must concur in nominating another to act for them or in applying for
appointment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  Conservators of the estates of protected persons or, if there is no
conservator, any guardian except a guardian ad litem of a minor or incapacitated
person may exercise the same right to nominate, to object to another's
appointment, or to participate in determining the preference of a majority in
interest of the heirs and devisees that the protected person or ward would have if
qualified for appointment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  Appointment of a person with priority, a person who is nominated
pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, or a person whose entitlement to
appointment results from renunciation by another person with priority may be made
in an informal proceeding. Before formal appointment of one without priority, the
court must determine that those having priority, although given notice of the
proceedings, have failed to request appointment or to nominate another for
appointment and that administration is necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(6)  No person is qualified to serve as a personal representative who is:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Under the age of twenty-one;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  A person whom the court finds unsuitable in formal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(7)  A personal representative appointed by a court of the decedent's
domicile has priority over all other persons except where the decedent's will
nominates different persons to be personal representative in this state and in the
state of domicile. The domiciliary personal representative may nominate another,
who shall have the same priority as the domiciliary personal representative.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(8)  This section governs priority for appointment of a successor personal
representative but does not apply to the selection of a special administrator.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(9)  If there be more than one fiduciary of an estate, and one of such
fiduciaries shall die, resign, or be removed, the court may in its discretion appoint a
successor fiduciary to act in place and instead of the former fiduciary, together
with the remaining fiduciary or fiduciaries, or the court may permit the remaining
fiduciary or fiduciaries to serve without any new or additional fiduciary; except that,
if there be a will providing for the fiduciaries, the provisions of the will shall control
when applicable.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>15-12-401.  Formal testacy proceedings - nature - when commenced. </STRONG>(1)  A
formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid
will. A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing
a petition as described in section 15-12-402 (1) in which he requests that the court,
after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an
informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will which is the
subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with section 15-12-402
(4) for an order that the decedent died intestate.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether
the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated. A formal testacy
proceeding may, but need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal
representative.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the registrar shall
not act upon any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any
application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests
confirmation of the previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal
representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate
proceeding, must refrain from exercising his power to make any further distribution
of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding. A petitioner who seeks
the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also
may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from
exercising any of the powers of his office and requesting the appointment of a
special administrator. In the absence of a request, or if the request is denied, the
commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a
previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to
distribution.</SPAN></P>

from the date of the decedent's death. At the end of the claims period, the public

allowed claimants pursuant to the priorities set forth in section 15-12-805. The
remainder of the estate's funds, if any, must be distributed to the decedent's heirs
or devisees as determined under this code. In determining who is entitled to an

document. The public administrator is not liable for any improper distributions made
in reasonable reliance on information contained in such affidavits. All estates
administered by a public administrator pursuant to the small estate procedure are
closed by the filing of a public administrator's statement of account with the
appointing district or probate court. The statement of account must set forth all

the public administrator's fees and costs, and the fees and costs of the public
administrator's staff and investigators. Copies of all fee statements reflecting such

administrator may authorize the cremation or natural reduction of the decedent's
remains if the decedent left signed written instructions, or other funeral
arrangements authorized by the decedent, that indicated the decedent's wish to be
cremated or naturally reduced. A public administrator may authorize cremation or
natural reduction if public funds will be needed to complete the administration of
an estate because the estate lacks the apparent assets to pay fully all necessary
administration, funeral, and burial costs and expenses. In cases of doubt, the public
administrator may decline to authorize cremation or natural reduction.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(8)  Whenever a public administrator is administering or investigating a
decedent's estate, the public administrator or the public administrator's authorized
employee or agent may make an immediate search for the decedent's assets and
burial instructions; and in furtherance thereof, a public administrator may prepare a
certificate stating that he or she is a public administrator administering or
investigating the estate of the decedent, that the decedent died on a stated date,
and that such person may have assets or a will or burial instructions which are
needed for the proper administration of the decedent's estate. Any entity, person,
bank, corporation, or financial institution that receives such a certificate shall
promptly release to the public administrator, or to the public administrator's
authorized employees or agents, all information that such entity has at its disposal
concerning any assets in which the decedent had any interest, whether such assets
be jointly or individually owned; and any such entity, person, bank, corporation, or
financial institution shall promptly grant access to the public administrator, or to
the public administrator's authorized employees or agents, to any safe deposit box
which the decedent had the right of entry to search and remove any will or burial
instructions concerning the decedent's estate. For this preliminary investigation,
the public administrator shall not be required to furnish a death certificate, an
affidavit pursuant to section 15-12-1201, or letters. If a will, codicil, or burial
instructions concerning the decedent is discovered as a result of this investigation,
upon giving a receipt for same, the public administrator, or the public
administrator's authorized employee or agent, shall be entitled to receive the
original of such document. The public administrator shall lodge the original of any
will or codicil so discovered in the district or probate court having proper
jurisdiction. A copy of such instrument shall be provided to any heir or devisee of
the decedent who requests it. Any costs incurred in the drilling of a safe deposit
box or the copying of any estate documents shall be paid by the estate of the
decedent. If any burial instructions are found, the public administrator shall
promptly deliver such instructions to the person or persons who have the right to
dispose of the decedent's remains. Receipt of a certificate of the public
administrator as provided by this section shall fully discharge any entity, person,
bank, corporation, or other financial institution from all liability for the release of
any information concerning the decedent's assets or the granting of access to a
safe deposit box, or for any acts or omissions by the public administrator with
reference to these items, without the necessity of inquiring into the truth of any
facts stated in the certificate. Any entity, person, bank, corporation, or other
financial institution who refuses to honor a properly presented certificate as
provided in this section shall be liable for all damages and costs, including
reasonable attorney fees and costs, suffered by the estate as a result of the failure
of such entity to comply with the public administrator's request for information.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(9)  A public administrator may act as a special administrator in a decedent's

having the public administrator represent the estate in an action to be brought by
the creditor or claimant against the estate. A public administrator requested to act
as a special administrator in such cases need act only if the creditor or claimant
makes advance arrangements, satisfactory to the public administrator, to pay all
reasonable fees and costs likely to be incurred by the public administrator in the
public administrator's performance as special administrator regardless of the
outcome of the creditor's or claimant's claim or litigation against the estate.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>15-12-622.  Public administrator - acting as conservator or trustee. </STRONG>(1) 
When appointed by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the public administrator may
act as a conservator, temporary conservator, special conservator, trustee, or other
fiduciary of any estate that has assets requiring protection. Each county
department of human or social services may refer any resident of that county, or
any nonresident located in that county, to that county's public administrator for
appropriate protective proceedings if the department determines that the person
meets the standards required for court protective action.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  Any case referred to the public administrator pursuant to this section by
a county department of human or social services must be presented to the court of
appropriate jurisdiction by a petition that states to the court that the public
administrator has been requested by the county department of human or social
services to act as a conservator or other fiduciary for the person in need of
protection, that the public administrator is the nominee of that department, and
that the public administrator is not acting as an attorney for that department. The
public administrator may prepare and file such a petition if requested to do so by
the county department of human or social services. The fact that a public
administrator has been requested by a county department of human or social
services to act as a conservator or other fiduciary shall not be construed by the
court as granting any priority for his or her appointment, and the court shall make
that determination solely upon the best interests of the person in need of
protection. If the public administrator is not appointed as conservator or other
fiduciary and the court determines that another individual should act as the
conservator or fiduciary, the court may award reasonable fees and costs to the
public administrator if the court determines that the efforts of the public
administrator were beneficial to the estate or contributed to the protection of the
protected person's assets. In cases where the court awards fees and costs to the
public administrator, to the extent that such funds are available, such fees must be
paid from the protected person's estate. In cases in which the public administrator
is not compensated from the protected person's estate, the court may approve the
payment of such fees from state funds designated for the payment of court-appointed counsel or fiduciaries. The court may determine the amount of fees to be
paid from such state funds as it deems to be just.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  In any case in which the public administrator has been nominated to act
as conservator or other fiduciary at the request of the county department of human
or social services and the case develops into a contested court proceeding, the
department's own attorney shall assume all aspects of the contested court case,
and the public administrator must not be required to be involved in such hearings
unless specifically directed to do so by the court.</SPAN></P>

services of attorneys, paralegals, bookkeepers, certified public accountants,
investigators, tax counsel, or any other professional or nonprofessional who
provides necessary services which further the cost-effective administration of the
estates. A public administrator who is a member of a law firm may use the legal
services of that firm to assist the public administrator in his or her duties as the
public administrator or as a fiduciary. All fees of the public administrator or of the
public administrator's agents and employees are subject to review by the court
having jurisdiction over the estate in which the fees were incurred. The payment of
public administrators' administrative fees and costs shall have priority over all other
claims and exempt property or family allowances. In cases in which the public

account shall not exceed the federal deposit insurance limits for such accounts.
When an additional account is required, such account shall be opened in a different
Colorado bank or savings and loan association which has the required federal

</STRONG>(1)  A personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the standards of care
applicable to trustees as described by part 8 of article 5 of this title 15. A personal
representative is under a duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in
accordance with the terms of any probated and effective will and this code, and as
expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate.
The personal representative shall use the authority conferred by this code, the

representative is party for the best interests of successors to the estate.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  A personal representative shall not be surcharged for acts of
administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time.
Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will is
authority to administer and distribute the estate according to its terms. An order of
appointment of a personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal
proceedings, is authority to distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the
decedent if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a
pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier
testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning the personal representative's
appointment or fitness to continue, or a supervised administration proceeding. This
section does not affect the duty of the personal representative to administer and
distribute the estate in accordance with the rights of claimants whose claims have
been allowed, the surviving spouse, any minor and dependent children, and any
omitted child of the decedent as described elsewhere in this code.</SPAN></P>

higher priority for appointment than was conferred upon such proponent pursuant
to section 15-12-203 before the will was offered for probate.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The personal representative has standing to oppose, at estate expense, a

the personal representative and his or her agents in providing basic information to
the parties regarding the augmented estate are payable as an estate expense. The
personal representative may prepare a calculation of the augmented estate at
estate expense.</SPAN></P>

interest, any interested person may petition the court pursuant to section 15-12-614

conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>

not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety

representatives which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 15-12-504, no

instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in
proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged

presented, the decedent's estate must first have been commenced in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction by the filing of an application or petition pursuant to part 3
or 4 of this article. A claimant may thereafter present a claim only by:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Filing a written statement of the claim with the clerk of the court, in the
form approved by the supreme court, whether or not a personal representative has
been appointed;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Delivering or mailing a written statement of the claim to the court-appointed personal representative; or</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  In the case of a claimant who has a claim described in section 15-12-803
(1), presenting a claim by commencing a proceeding against the personal
representative in the court where the personal representative was appointed to
obtain payment of the claim. A claimant having a claim described in section 15-12-803 (2) may present a claim by commencing a proceeding against the personal
representative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to
jurisdiction under the rules of civil procedure or statutes of this state to obtain
payment of his or her claim against the estate. In order to constitute a timely
presentation of a claim, the commencement of any proceeding under this
paragraph (c) must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim. Time
limits on proceedings to enforce timely presented claims are determined by section
15-12-806 (1) and not by this paragraph (c).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  Unless presentation is made pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of
this section, a claim against a decedent's estate is not validly presented by
delivering or mailing a claim to any person unless that person has been appointed
by the court or registrar of the court as the personal representative of the
decedent's estate prior to the time the presentation is attempted.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  A personal representative's knowledge that a creditor could bring a claim
against an estate shall not be treated as a valid substitute for the proper
presentation of a written claim authorized by subsection (1) of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  A request or demand for payment from the decedent or the estate; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Sufficient information to allow the personal representative to investigate
and respond to the claim, including the basis of the claim, the name and address of
the claimant, and the amount claimed.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  Except in the situation where a special administrator has been formally
appointed with specific powers to deal with the specific claim being presented or
has been formally appointed to deal with claims generally under this part 8, a
special administrator appointed in informal proceedings, or a special administrator
who lacks the powers and authority of a general personal representative, is not a
personal representative to whom presentation of a claim may properly be made.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(6)  A claim shall be deemed presented on the date that the court-appointed
personal representative receives the written statement of claim or the date the
claim is filed with the court, whichever is earlier. If a claim is not yet due, the claim
shall state the date when it will become due. If the claim is contingent or
unliquidated, the claim shall state the nature of the uncertainty. If the claim is
secured, the claim shall describe the security. Failure to describe correctly the
security, the nature of any uncertainty, or the due date of a claim not yet due does
not invalidate the presentation made.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(7)  The personal representative shall inform any interested person, upon
request, as to the existence, amounts, and nature of all claims against the estate
that are known to him or her, but the personal representative shall not be required
to express any opinion as to the probable outcome of any claim.</SPAN></P>

thereon may not be commenced more than sixty-three days after the personal
representative has mailed a notice of disallowance; except that, in the case of a
claim that is not presently due or that is contingent or unliquidated, the personal
representative may consent to an extension of the sixty-three-day period, or, to
avoid injustice, the court, on petition, may order an extension of the sixty-three-day
period, but in no event shall the extension run beyond the applicable statute of
limitations.</SPAN></P>

properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and

which cannot be partitioned without prejudice to the owners and which cannot
conveniently be allotted to any one party.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Fiduciary means personal representative or trustee.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Person means any individual, partnership, association, joint stock
company, corporation, government, political subdivision, governmental agency, or
local governmental agency.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Person interested in the estate means any person entitled to receive, or
who has received, from a decedent or by reason of the death of a decedent any
property or interest therein included in the decedent's estate. It includes a personal
representative, conservator, and trustee.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  State means any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the
District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  Tax means the federal estate tax, the additional inheritance tax
imposed by section 26-2-113, C.R.S., the Colorado estate tax imposed by article
23.5 of title 39, C.R.S., and interest and penalties imposed in addition to the tax.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  Unless otherwise provided in the will or other dispositive instrument, the
tax shall be apportioned among all persons interested in the estate, subject to the
exceptions specified in this section. The apportionment is to be made in the
proportion that the value of the interest of each person interested in the estate
bears to the total value of the interests of all persons interested in the estate. The
values used in determining the tax are to be used for tax apportionment purposes.
In all instances not involving a spouse unprovided for in a will as provided in section
15-11-301 or an election by a surviving spouse as provided in section 15-11-202, if the
decedent's will or other dispositive instrument directs a method of apportionment
of tax different from the method described in this code, the method described in
the will or other dispositive instrument controls. In instances involving such a
spouse unprovided for in a will or election, if the decedent's will or other dispositive
instrument directs a method of apportionment of tax different from the method
described in this code, the apportionment of tax to the spouse unprovided for in the
will or to the surviving spouse shall be in accordance with the method described in
this code, and the apportionment of tax to the remaining persons interested in the
estate shall be in accordance with the method described in the will or other
dispositive instrument.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3) (a)  The court in which venue lies for the administration of the estate of a
decedent, on petition for the purpose, may determine the apportionment of the tax.</SPAN></P>

in the manner provided in subsection (2) of this section, because of special
circumstances, it may direct apportionment thereof in the manner it finds equitable.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  If the court finds that the assessment of penalties and interest assessed
in relation to the tax is due to delay caused by the negligence of the fiduciary, the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  In any action to recover from any person interested in the estate the
amount of the tax apportioned to the person in accordance with this code, the
determination of the court in respect thereto shall be prima facie correct.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4) (a)  The personal representative or other person in possession of the
property of the decedent required to pay the tax may withhold from any property
distributable to any person interested in the estate, upon its distribution to him, the
amount of tax attributable to his interest. If the property in possession of the
personal representative or other person required to pay the tax and distributable to
any person interested in the estate is insufficient to satisfy the proportionate
amount of the tax determined to be due from the person, the personal
representative or other person required to pay the tax may recover the deficiency
from the person interested in the estate. If the property is not in the possession of
the personal representative or the other person required to pay the tax, the
personal representative or the other person required to pay the tax may recover
from any person interested in the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the
person in accordance with this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  If property held by the personal representative is distributed prior to final
apportionment of the tax, the distributee shall provide a bond or other security for
the apportionment liability in the form and amount prescribed by the personal
representative.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5) (a)  In making an apportionment, allowances shall be made for any
exemptions granted, any classification made of persons interested in the estate,
and for any deductions and credits allowed by the law imposing the tax.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Any exemption or deduction allowed by reason of the relationship of any
person to the decedent or by reason of the purposes of the gift inures to the benefit
of the person bearing such relationship or receiving the gift; but, if an interest is
subject to a prior present interest which is not allowable as a deduction, the tax
apportionable against the present interest shall be paid from principal.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Any deduction for property previously taxed and any credit for gift taxes
or death taxes of a foreign country paid by the decedent or his estate inures to the
proportionate benefit of all persons liable to apportionment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Any credit for inheritance, succession, or estate taxes or taxes in the
nature thereof applicable to property or interests includable in the estate inures to
the benefit of the persons or interests chargeable with the payment thereof to the
extent proportionately that the credit reduces the tax.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  To the extent that property passing to or in trust for a surviving spouse or
any charitable, public, or similar gift or devise is not an allowable deduction for
purposes of the tax solely by reason of an inheritance tax or other death tax
imposed upon and deductible from the property, the property is not included in the
computation provided for in subsection (2) of this section, and to that extent no
apportionment is made against the property. The provisions of this paragraph (e) do
not apply to any case if the result would be to deprive the estate of a deduction
otherwise allowable under section 2053(d) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, of the United States, relating to deduction for state death taxes
on transfers for public, charitable, or religious uses.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(6)  No interest in income and no estate for years or for life or other
temporary interest in any property or fund is subject to apportionment as between
the temporary interest and the remainder. The tax on the temporary interest and
the tax, if any, on the remainder is chargeable against the corpus of the property or
funds subject to the temporary interest and remainder.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(7)  Neither the personal representative nor other person required to pay the
tax is under any duty to institute any action to recover from any person interested in
the estate the amount of the tax apportioned to the person until the expiration of
the three months next following final determination of the tax. A personal
representative or other person required to pay the tax who institutes the action
within a reasonable time after the three months' period is not subject to any liability
or surcharge because any portion of the tax apportioned to any person interested in
the estate was collectible at a time following the death of the decedent but
thereafter became uncollectible. If the personal representative or other person
required to pay the tax cannot collect from any person interested in the estate the
amount of the tax apportioned to the person, the amount not recoverable shall be
equitably apportioned among the other persons interested in the estate who are
subject to apportionment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(8)  A personal representative acting in another state or a person required to
pay the tax domiciled in another state may institute an action in the courts of this
state and may recover a proportionate amount of the federal estate tax, of an
estate tax payable to another state, or of a death duty due by a decedent's estate
to another state, from a person interested in the estate who is either domiciled in
this state or who owns property in this state subject to attachment or execution. For
the purposes of the action the determination of apportionment by the court having
jurisdiction of the administration of the decedent's estate in the other state is prima
facie correct.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(9)  If the liabilities of persons interested in the estate as prescribed by this
code differ from those which result under the federal estate tax law, the liabilities
imposed by the federal law shall control, and all other provisions of this code shall
apply as if the amounts and liabilities prescribed by the federal law had been
prescribed by subsection (2) of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>15-12-1402.  Definitions. </STRONG>As used in this part 14, unless the context otherwise
requires:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(1)  Apportionable estate means the value of the gross estate as finally
determined for purposes of the estate tax to be apportioned, reduced by:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Any claim or expense allowable as a deduction for purposes of the estate
tax;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The value of any interest in property that, for purposes of the estate tax,
qualifies for a marital or charitable deduction or is otherwise deductible or exempt;
and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Any amount added to the decedent's gross estate because of a gift tax
on transfers made before death.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  Apportionment provision means any provision of a dispositive
instrument having the effect of allocating estate tax to certain property or
recipients, or exonerating certain property or recipients from liability for estate tax.
An apportionment provision may include, but is not equivalent to, a provision
affecting rights of recovery or reimbursement under federal estate tax law.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  Estate tax means a federal, state, or foreign tax imposed because of
the death of an individual and interest and penalties associated with the tax. The
term does not include an inheritance tax, income tax, or generation-skipping
transfer tax other than a generation-skipping transfer tax incurred on a direct skip
taking effect on death.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  Gross estate means, with respect to an estate tax, all interests in
property subject to the estate tax.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  Person has the same meaning as set forth in section 15-10-201 (38).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(6)  Ratable means apportioned or allocated pro rata according to the
relative values of interests to which the term is to be applied. Ratably has a
corresponding meaning.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(7)  Time-limited interest means an interest in property that terminates on a
lapse of time or on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event or that is subject
to the exercise of discretion that could transfer a beneficial interest to another
person. The term does not include a cotenancy unless the cotenancy itself is a time-limited interest.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(8)  Value means, with respect to an interest in property, fair market value
as finally determined for purposes of the estate tax that is to be apportioned,
reduced by any outstanding debt secured by the interest without reduction for
taxes paid or required to be paid or for any special valuation adjustment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>15-12-1403.  Apportionment by will or other dispositive instrument. </STRONG>(1) 
Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, the following rules
apply:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  To the extent that a provision of a decedent's will expressly and
unambiguously directs the apportionment of an estate tax, the tax shall be
apportioned accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Any portion of an estate tax not apportioned pursuant to paragraph (a) of
this subsection (1) shall be apportioned in accordance with any provision of a
revocable trust of which the decedent was the settlor that expressly and
unambiguously directs the apportionment of an estate tax. If conflicting
apportionment provisions appear in two or more revocable trust instruments, the
provision in the most recently dated instrument prevails. For purposes of this
paragraph (b):</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  A trust is revocable if it was revocable immediately after the trust
instrument was executed, even if the trust subsequently becomes irrevocable; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  The date of an amendment to a revocable trust instrument is the date of
the amended instrument only if the amendment contains an apportionment
provision.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  If any portion of an estate tax is not apportioned pursuant to paragraph
(a) or (b) of this subsection (1), and a provision in any other dispositive instrument
expressly and unambiguously directs that any interest in the property disposed of
by the instrument is or is not to be applied to the payment of the estate tax
attributable to the interest disposed of by the instrument, the provision controls the
apportionment of the tax to that interest.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  Subject to subsections (3) and (4) of this section, and unless the decedent
expressly and unambiguously directs to the contrary, the following rules apply:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  If an apportionment provision specifically directs that a person receiving
an interest in a property under an instrument is to be exonerated from the
responsibility to pay an estate tax that would otherwise be apportioned the interest:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  The tax attributable to the exonerated interest shall be apportioned
among other persons receiving interests in the apportionable estate passing under
the same instrument; or</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  The deficiency shall be apportioned ratably among other persons
receiving interests in the apportionable estate that are not exonerated from
apportionment of the tax if the values of the other interests are less than the tax
attributable to the exonerated interest.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  If an apportionment provision directs that an estate tax is to be
apportioned to a specific interest in property, recipients of other interests in the
apportionable estate are indirectly exonerated from the responsibility to pay such
tax; however, such indirect exoneration does not preclude the application of section
15-12-1404 if the value of the interest to which the tax is apportioned is insufficient
to pay the tax in full.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  If an apportionment provision directs that an estate tax is to be
apportioned to a specific interest in property, a portion of which qualifies for a
marital or charitable deduction, the estate tax shall first be apportioned ratably
among the holders of the portion that does not qualify for a marital or charitable
deduction and then apportioned ratably among the holders of the deductible
portion to the extent that the value of the nondeductible portion is insufficient.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Except as otherwise provided for in paragraph (e) of this subsection (2), if
an apportionment provision directs that an estate tax be apportioned to property in
which one or more time-limited interests exist, other than interests in specified
property under section 15-12-1407, the tax shall be apportioned to the principal of
that property, regardless of the deductibility of some of the interests in that
property.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  If an apportionment provision directs that an estate tax is to be
apportioned to the holders of interests in property in which one or more time-limited interests exist and a charity has an interest that otherwise qualifies for an
estate tax charitable deduction, the tax shall first be apportioned, to the extent
feasible, to interests in property that have not been distributed to persons entitled
to receive the interests.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  A provision that apportions an estate tax is ineffective to the extent that
it increases the tax apportioned to a person having an interest in the gross estate
over which the decedent has no power to transfer immediately before the decedent
executed the instrument in which the apportionment direction was made. For
purposes of this subsection (3), a testamentary power of appointment is a power to
transfer the property that is subject to the power.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  An apportionment provision expressly directing estate taxes to be paid
from the residue of the subject probate or trust estate, or using language of
similar effect, shall be subject to the following construction:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  If the gross estate includes assets not passing under the dispositive
instrument and the beneficiaries of those assets and the beneficiaries of the
residue are different persons, this part 14 shall apply unless there is an express and
unambiguous statement that the estate tax attributable to the assets shall also be
paid from the residue.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  If the dispositive instrument contains pre-residuary gifts and the
residuary estate is insufficient to pay all estate taxes due, the apportionment
provision directing payment from the residue shall be effective with respect to the
residue as provided for pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of this section,
and this part 14 shall apply only to specify the source of payment for estate tax that
cannot be paid from the residue. In this event, neither section 15-12-902 nor any
other statutory or common law rule of abatement shall affect the apportionment of
estate tax among the pre-residuary gifts.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  When a gift qualifying for an estate tax marital or charitable deduction is
made from a portion of the residue, the provisions of paragraph (c) of subsection (2)
of this section shall apply, unless there is an express and unambiguous statement
in the dispositive instrument of an intent to not fully utilize the available marital or
charitable deduction. For this purpose, a direction to pay estate tax from the
residue without apportionment or right of contribution, or language of similar
effect, does not constitute an express and unambiguous statement sufficient to
avoid the application of paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  An express and unambiguous apportionment of estate tax pursuant to
this section does not, by itself, affect rights of recovery that may be available to a
fiduciary under federal tax law. An intent to waive a right of recovery provided in
sections 2206, 2207, 2207A, and 2207B of the internal revenue code of 1986, as
amended, shall be expressly stated in the dispositive instrument in the manner
described in such sections.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>15-12-1404.  Statutory apportionment of estate taxes. </STRONG>(1)  To the extent that
apportionment of an estate tax is not controlled by an instrument described in
section 15-12-1403, and except as otherwise provided for in sections 15-12-1406 and
15-12-1407, the following rules apply:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Subject to paragraphs (b) to (d) of this subsection (1), the estate tax shall
be apportioned ratably to each person that has an interest in the apportionable
estate.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  A generation-skipping transfer tax incurred on a direct skip taking effect
at death shall be charged to the person to which the interest in property is
transferred.</SPAN></P>

2044 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, or any similar estate tax
provision, the difference between the total estate tax for which the decedent's
estate is liable and the amount of estate tax for which the decedent's estate would
have been liable if the property had not been included in the decedent's gross
estate shall be apportioned ratably among the holders of interests in the property.
The balance of the tax, if any, shall be apportioned ratably to each other person
having an interest in the apportionable estate.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Except as otherwise provided for in section 15-12-1403 (2)(d), and except
as to property to which section 15-12-1407 applies, an estate tax apportioned to

action that the court deems appropriate or from appointing an attorney, guardian

that individual, related to his or her decision to participate in the termination

the court may impose restrictions upon the conservator's access to, or transfer of,
the assets of the conservatorship estate. Unless otherwise directed by the court,
the cost of the bond shall be charged to the protected person's estate and the bond
must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate
in the conservator's control, plus one year's estimated income, and minus the value
of assets deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their
removal and the value of any real property that the fiduciary, by express limitation,
lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization. The court, in place of
sureties on a bond, may accept collateral for the performance of the bond,
including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of real property.</SPAN></P>

To facilitate this research, the clerk of the court or his or her designee shall have

all property of the protected person, or to the part thereof specified in the order,
held at the time of appointment or thereafter acquired, including title to any
property held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys-in-fact. An order
vesting title in the conservator to only a part of the property of the protected
person creates a conservatorship limited to assets specified in the order.
Notwithstanding the language vesting title in the conservator in this section, this
vesting of title shall not be construed to sever any joint tenancies.</SPAN></P>

within the meaning of the general provisions of any federal or state statute or
regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will or trust instrument
imposing restrictions upon or penalties for the transfer or alienation by the
protected person of his or her rights or interest, but this section does not restrict
the ability of a person to make specific provisions by contract or dispositive
instrument relating to a conservator.</SPAN></P>

protected as though the conservator properly exercised the power. That a person
knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into
the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, but restrictions on powers
of conservators that are endorsed on letters as provided in section 15-14-110 are

expend or distribute income or principal of the estate of the protected person

dependent on the protected person, including the payment of child support or

appropriate standard of support, care, education, health, and welfare for the
protected person or an individual who is in fact dependent on the protected person

furnishing support, care, education, or benefit to a protected person, or an
individual who is in fact dependent on the protected person, in accordance with the
recommendations of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless the
conservator knows that the parent or guardian derives personal financial benefit
therefrom, including relief from any personal duty of support, or the
recommendations are not in the best interest of the protected person.</SPAN></P>

consider:</SPAN></P>

the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully self-sufficient and able to manage his or her business affairs and the estate;</SPAN></P>

advance payments are customary or reasonably necessary under the

representative or devisees named in the will of the delivery, and retain the estate

their presentation and allowance in accordance with the priorities stated in

presentation. The conservator before payment may change an allowance or
deemed allowance to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance
under a court order or judgment or an order directing payment of the claim. The
presentation of a claim tolls the running of any statute of limitations relating to the
claim until thirty-five days after its disallowance. If a claim is not yet due, the claim
shall state the date when it will become due. If a claim is contingent or unliquidated,
the claim shall state the nature of the uncertainty or the anticipated due date of the
claim.</SPAN></P>

upon the death of the protected person or upon order of the court determining that
a conservatorship is no longer necessary or needed to protect the assets of the
protected person. Unless created for reasons other than that the protected person
is a minor, a conservatorship created for a minor also terminates when the
protected person attains the age of twenty-one years. Upon learning of the

convincing evidence that continuation of the conservatorship is still statutorily
warranted and is still in the best interest of the protected person.</SPAN></P>

instructions, the conservator shall file such initial pleadings within twenty-one days
after the petition to terminate has been filed. Any interested person shall then have
fourteen days to file a response. If a response is filed, the conservator shall have
seven days to file a reply. If a motion for instructions is filed by the conservator as
his or her initial pleading, the court shall rule on that motion before the petition for
termination of the conservatorship is set for hearing. Unless a hearing on the motion
for instructions is requested by the court, the court may rule on the pleadings
without a hearing after the time period for the filing of the last responsive pleading
has expired. After the filing of the conservator's initial motion for instructions, the
conservator may file subsequent motions for instruction as appropriate.</SPAN></P>

subsection (4.5) or as otherwise ordered by the court, the conservator may not take
any action to oppose or interfere in the termination proceeding. The filing of the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	The catalyst for the Uniform
Power of Attorney Act (the Act) was
a national review of state power of
attorney legislation. The review
revealed growing divergence among
states' statutory treatment of powers
of attorney. The original Uniform
Durable Power of Attorney Act
(Original Act), last amended in 1987,
was at one time followed by all but a
few jurisdictions. Despite initial
uniformity, the review found that a
majority of states had enacted non-uniform provisions to deal with
specific matters upon which the
Original Act is silent. The topics about
which there was increasing
divergence included: 1) the authority
of multiple agents; 2) theauthority of a
later-appointed fiduciary or guardian;
3) the impact of dissolution or
annulment of the principal's marriage
to the agent; 4) activation of
contingent powers; 5) the authority to
make gifts; and 6) standards for agent
conduct and liability. Other topics
about which states had legislated,
although not necessarily in a
divergent manner, included: successor
agents, execution requirements,
portability, sanctions for dishonor of a
power of attorney, and restrictions on
authority that has the potential to
dissipate a principal's property or alter
a principal's estate plan.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	A national survey was then
conductedby the Joint Editorial Board
for Uniform Trust and Estate Acts
(JEB) to ascertain whether there was
actual divergence of opinion about
default rules for powers of attorney or
only the lack of a detailed uniform
model. The survey was distributed to
probate and elder law sections of all
state bar associations, to the fellows
of the American College of Trust and
Estate Counsel, the leadership of the
ABA Section of Real Property, Probate
and Trust Law and the National
Academy of Elder Law Attorneys, as
well as to special interest list serves
of the ABA Commission on Law and
Aging. Forty- four jurisdictions were
represented in the 371 surveys
returned.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	The survey responses
demonstrated a consensus of opinion
in excess of seventy percent that a
power of attorney statute should:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(1) provide for confirmation that
contingent powers are activated;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2) revoke a spouse-agent's
authority upon the dissolution or
annulment of the marriage to the
principal;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3) include a portability
provision;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4) require gift making authority
to be expressly stated in the grant of
authority;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5) provide a default standard
for fiduciary duties;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(6) permit the principal to alter
the default fiduciary standard;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(7) require notice by an agent
when the agent is no longer willing or
able to act;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(8) include safeguards against
abuse by the agent;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(9) include remedies and
sanctions for abuse by the agent;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(10) protect the reliance of
other persons on a power of attorney;
and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(11) include remedies and
sanctions for refusal of other persons
to honor a power of attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Informed by the review and the
survey results, the Conference's
drafting process also incorporated
input from the American College of
Trust and Estate Counsel, the ABA
Section of Real Property, Probate and
Trust Law, the ABA Commission on
Law and Aging, the Joint Editorial
Board for Uniform Trust and Estate
Acts, the National Conference of
Lawyers and Corporate Fiduciaries,
the American Bankers Association,
AARP, other professional groups, as
well as numerous individual lawyers
and corporate counsel. As a result of
this process, the Act codifies both
state legislative trends and collective
best practices, and strikes a balance
between the need for flexibility and
acceptance of an agent's authority
and the need to prevent and redress
financial abuse.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	While the Act contains
safeguards for the protection of an
incapacitated principal, the Act is
primarily a set of default rules that
preserve a principal's freedom to
choose both the extent of an agent's
authority and the principles to govern
the agent's conduct. Among the Act's
features that enhance drafting
flexibility are the statutory definitions
of powers in Subpart 2, which can be
incorporated by reference in an
individually drafted power of attorney
or selected for inclusion on the
optional statutory form provided in
Subpart 3. The statutory definitions of
enumerated powers are an updated
version of those in the Uniform
Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act
(1988), which the Act supersedes. The
national review found that eighteen
jurisdictions had adopted some type
of statutory form power of attorney.
The decision to include a statutory
form power of attorney in the Act was
based on this trend and the
proliferation of power of attorney
forms currently available to the public.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Sections 15-14-719 and 15-14-720 of the Act address the problem of
persons refusing to accept an agent's
authority. Section 15-14-719 provides
protection from liabilityfor persons
that in good faith accept an
acknowledged power of attorney.
Section 15-14-720 sanctions refusal to
accept an acknowledged power of
attorney unless the refusal meets
limited statutory exceptions. An
alternate Section 15-14-720 is
provided for states that may wish to
limit sanctions to refusal of an
acknowledged statutory form power
of attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	In exchange for mandated
acceptance of an agent's authority,
the Act does not require persons that
deal with an agent to investigate the
agent or the agent's actions. Instead,
safeguards against abuse are
provided through heightened
requirements for granting authority
that could dissipate the principal's
property or alter the principal's estate
plan (Section 15-14-724(1)), provisions
that set out the agent's duties and
liabilities (Sections 15-14-714 and 15-14-717) and by specification of the
categories of persons that have
standing to request judicial review of
the agent's conduct (Section 15-14-716). The following provides a brief
overview of the entire Act.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans"><STRONG>Overview of the Uniform Power of
Attorney Act</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	The Act consists of 4 Subparts.
The basic substance of the Act is
located in subparts 1 and 2. Subpart 3
contains the optional statutory form
and Subpart 4 consists of
miscellaneous provisions dealing with
general application of the Act and
repeal of certain prior acts.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>Subpart 1 -- General
Provisions and Definitions --</STRONG> Section
15-14-702 lists definitions which are
useful in interpretation of the Act. Of
particular note is the definition of
incapacity which replaces the term
disability used in the Original Act.
The definition of incapacity is
consistent with the standard for
appointment of aconservator under
Section 401 of the Uniform
Guardianship and Protective
Proceedings Act as amended in 1997.
Another significant change in
terminology from the Original Act is
the use of agent in place of the term
attorney in fact. The term agent
was also used in the Uniform
Statutory Form Power of Attorney Act
and is intended to clarify confusion in
the lay public about the meaning of
attorney in fact. Section 15-14-703
provides that the Act is to apply
broadly to all powers of attorney, but
excepts from the Act powers of
attorney for health care and certain
specialized powers such as those
coupled with an interest or dealing
with proxy voting.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Another innovation is the
default rule in Section 15-14-704 that
a power of attorney is durable unless
it contains express language
indicating otherwise. This change from
the Original Act reflects the view that
most principals prefer their powers of
attorney to be durable as a hedge
against the need for guardianship.
While the Original Act was silent on
execution requirements for a power of
attorney, Section 15-14-705 requires
the principal's signature and provides
that an acknowledged signature is
presumed genuine. Section 15-14-706
recognizes military powers of attorney
and powers of attorney properly
executed in other states or countries,
or which were properly executed in
the state of enactment prior to the
Act's effective date. Section 15-14-707 states a choice of law rule for
determining the law that governs the
meaning and effect of a power of
attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Section 15-14-708 addresses
the relationship of the agent to a later
court-appointed fiduciary. The
Original Act conferred upon a
conservator or other later-appointed
fiduciary the same power to revoke or
amend the power of attorney as the
principal would have had prior to
incapacity. In contrast, the Act
reserves this power to the court and
states that the agent's
authoritycontinues until limited,
suspended, or terminated by the court.
This approach reflects greater
deference for the previously
expressed preferences of the
principal and is consistent with the
state legislative trend that has
departed from the Original Act.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	The default rule for when a
power of attorney becomes effective
is stated in Section 15-14-709. Unless
the principal specifies that it is to
become effective upon a future date,
event, or contingency, the authority of
an agent under a power of attorney
becomes effective when the power is
executed. Section 15-14-709 permits
the principal to designate who may
determine when contingent powers
are triggered. If the trigger for
contingent powers is the principal's
incapacity, Section 15-14-709 provides
that the person designated to make
that determination has the authority
to act as the principal's personal
representative under the Health
Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) for
purposes of accessing the principal's
health-care information and
communicating with the principal's
health-care provider. This provision
does not, however, confer on the
designated person the authority to
make health-care decisions for the
principal. If the trigger for contingent
powers is incapacity but the principal
has not designated anyone to make
the determination, or the person
authorized is unable or unwilling to
make the determination, the
determination may be made by a
physician or licensed psychologist,
who must find that the principal's
ability to manage property or business
affairs is impaired, or by an attorney at
law, judge, or appropriate
governmental official, who must find
that the principal is missing, detained,
or unable to return to the United
States.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	The bases for termination of a
power of attorney are covered in
Section 15-14-710. In response to
concerns expressed in the JEB survey,
the Act provides as the default rule
that authority granted to a principal's
spouse isrevoked upon the
commencement of proceedings for
legal separation, marital dissolution or
annulment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Sections 15-14-711 through 15-14-718 address matters related to the
agent, including default rules for
coagents and successor agents
(Section 15-14-711), reimbursement
and compensation (Section 15-14-712),
an agent's acceptance of appointment
(Section 15-14-713), and the agent's
duties (Section 15-14-714). Section 15-14-715 provides that a principal may
lower the standard of liability for
agent conduct subject to a minimum
level of accountability for actions
taken dishonestly, with an improper
motive, or with reckless indifference
to the purposes of the power of
attorney or the best interest of the
principal. Section 15-14-716 sets out a
comprehensive list of persons that
may petition the court to review the
agent's conduct and Section 15-14-717
addresses agent liability. An agent
may resign by following the notice
procedures described in Section 15-14-718.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Sections 15-14-719 and 15-14-720 are included in the Act to address
the frequently reported problem of
persons refusing to accept a power of
attorney. Section 15-14-719 protects
persons that in good faith accept an
acknowledged power of attorney
without actual knowledge that the
power of attorney is revoked,
terminated, or invalid or that the agent
is exceeding or improperly exercising
the agent's powers. Subject to
statutory exceptions, alternative
Sections 15-14- 720 impose liability
for refusal to accept a power of
attorney. Alternative A sanctions
refusal of an acknowledged power of
attorney and Alternative B sanctions
only refusal of an acknowledged
statutory form power of attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Sections 15-14-721 through 15-14-723 address the relationship of the
Act to other law. Section 15-14-721
clarifies that the Act is supplemented
by the principles of common law and
equity to the extent those
principlesare not displaced by a
specific provision of the Act, and
Section 15-14-722 further clarifies
that the Act is not intended to
supersede any law applicable to
financial institutions or other entities.
With respect to remedies, Section 15-14-723 provides that the remedies
under the Act are not exclusive and do
not abrogate any other cause of action
or remedy that may be available under
the law of the enacting jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>Subpart 2 -- Authority --</STRONG> The
Act offers the drafting attorney
enhanced flexibility whether drafting
an individually tailored power of
attorney or using the statutory form.
Like the Uniform Statutory Form
Power of Attorney Act, Sections 15-14-727 through 15-14-740 of the Act
set forth detailed descriptions of
authority relating to subjects such as
real property, retirement plans,
and taxes, which a principal,
pursuant to Section 15-14-702, may
incorporate in full into the power of
attorney either by a reference to the
short descriptive term for the subject
used in the Act or to the section
number. Section 15-14-702 further
states that a principal may modify in a
power of attorney any authority
incorporated by reference. The
definitions in Subpart 2 also provide
meaning for authority with respect to
subjects enumerated on the optional
statutory form in Subpart 3. Section
15-14-726 applies to all incorporated
authority and grants of general
authority, providing further detail on
how the authority is to be construed.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Subpart 2 also addresses
concerns about authority that might
be used to dissipate the principal's
property or alter the principal's estate
plan. Section 15-14-721(1) lists specific
categories of authority that cannot be
implied from a grant of general
authority, but which may be granted
only through express language in the
power of attorney. Section 15-14-724(2)contains a default rule
prohibiting an agent that is not an
ancestor, spouse, or descendant of
the principal from creating in the
agent or in a person to whom the
agent owes a legal obligation of
support an interest in the principal's
property, whether by gift, right of
survivorship, beneficiary designation,
disclaimer, or otherwise.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>Subpart 3 -- Statutory Forms
--</STRONG> The optional form in Subpart 3 is
designed for use by lawyers as well as
lay persons. It contains, in plain
language, instructions to the principal
and agent. Step-by-step prompts are
given for designation of the agent and
successor agents, and grant of
general and specific authority. In the
section of the form addressing
general authority, the principal must
initial the subjects over which the
principal wishes to delegate general
authority to the agent. In the section
of the form addressing specific
authority, the Section 15-14-724(1)
categories of specific authority are
listed, preceded by a warning to the
principal about the potential
consequences of granting such
authority to an agent. The principal is
instructed to initial only the specific
categories of actions that the
principal intends to authorize. Subpart
3 also contains a sample agent
certification form.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>Subpart 4 -- Miscellaneous
Provisions --</STRONG> The miscellaneous
provisions in Article 4 clarify the
relationship of the Act to other law
and pre-existing powers of attorney.
Enacting jurisdictions should repeal
their existing power of attorney
statutes, including, if applicable, the
Uniform Durable Power of Attorney
Act, The Uniform Statutory Form
Power of Attorney Act, and Article 5,
Part 5 of the Uniform Probate Code.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">OFFICIAL GENERAL COMMENT</SPAN></P>

<MULTICOL COLS="2" WIDTH="553" GUTTER="46">

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	The Uniform Power of Attorney
Act replaces the Uniform Durable
Power of Attorney Act, the Uniform
Statutory Form Power of Attorney
Act, and Article 5, Part 5 of the
Uniform Probate Code. The primary
purpose of the Uniform Durable Power
of Attorney Act was to provide
individuals with an inexpensive, non-judicial method of surrogate property
management in the event of later
incapacity. Two key concepts were
introduced by the Uniform Durable
Power of Attorney Act: 1) creation of a
durable agency one that survives, or is
triggered by, the principal's
incapacity, and 2) validation of post-mortem exercise of powers by an
agent who acts in good faith and
without actual knowledge of the
principal's death. The success of the
Uniform Durable Power of Attorney
Act is evidenced by the widespread
use of durable powers in every
jurisdiction, not only for incapacity
planning, but also for convenience
while the principal retains capacity.
However, the limitations of the
Uniform Durable Power of Attorney
Act are evidenced by the number of
states that have supplemented and
revised their statutes to address
myriad issues upon which the Uniform
Durable Power of Attorney Act is
silent. These issues include
parameters for the creation and use of
powers of attorney as well as
guidelines for the principal, the agent,
and the person who is asked to accept
the agent's authority. The general
provisions and definitions of Article 1
in the Uniform Power of Attorney Act
address those issues.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	In addition to providing greater
detail than the Uniform Durable Power
of Attorney Act, this Act changes two
presumptions in the earlier act: 1) that
a power of attorney is not durable
unless it contains language to make it
durable; and 2) that a later court-appointed fiduciary for the principal
has the power to revoke or amend a
previously executed power of
attorney. Section 15-14-704 of this
Subpart1 reverses the non-durability
presumption by stating that a power
of attorney is durable unless it
expressly provides that it is
terminated by the incapacity of the
principal. Section 15-14-708 gives
deference to the principal's choice of
agent by providing that if a court
appoints a fiduciary to manage some
or all of the principal's property, the
agent's authority continues unless
limited, suspended, or terminated by
the court.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Although the Act is primarily a
default statute, Subpart 1 also
contains rules that govern all powers
of attorney subject to the Act.
Examples of these rules include
imposition of certain minimum
fiduciary duties on an agent who has
accepted appointment (Section 15-14-714(1)), recognition of persons who
have standing to request judicial
construction of the power of attorney
or review of the agent's conduct
(Section 15-14-716), and protections
for persons who accept an
acknowledged power of attorney
without actual knowledge that the
power of attorney or the agent's
authority is void, invalid, or terminated,
or that the agent is exceeding or
improperly exercising the power
(Section 15-14-719). In contrast with
the rules of general application in
Subpart 1, the default provisions are
clearly indicated by signals such as
unless the power of attorney
otherwise provides,or except as
otherwise provided in the power of
attorney. These signals alert the
draftsperson to options for enlarging
or limiting the Act's default terms. For
example, default provisions in Article 1
state that, unless the power of
attorney otherwise provides, the
power of attorney is effective
immediately (Section 15-14-709),
coagents may exercise their authority
independently (Section 15-14-711), and
an agent is entitled to reimbursement
of expenses reasonably incurred and
to reasonable compensation (Section
15-14-712).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">OFFICIAL GENERAL COMMENT</SPAN></P>

<MULTICOL COLS="2" WIDTH="553" GUTTER="46">

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Subpart 2 is based in part on
the predecessor Uniform Statutory
Form Power of Attorney Act, approved
in 1988. It provides the default
statutory construction for authority
granted in a power of attorney.
Sections 15-14-727 through 15-14-740
describe authority with respect to
various subject matters. These
descriptions may be incorporated by
reference in the optional statutory
form (Section 15-14-741) or in an
individually drafted power of attorney.
Incorporation is accomplished either
by referring to the descriptive term for
the subject or by providing a citation
to the section in which the authority is
described (Section 15-14-725). A
principal may also modify any
authority incorporated by reference
(Section 15-14-725(3)). Section 15-14-726 supplements Sections 15-14-727
through 15-14-740 by providing
general terms of construction that
apply to all grants of authority under
those sections unless otherwise
indicated in the power of attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Most of the language in
Sections15-14-727 through 15-14-739
of Subpart 2 comes directly from the
Uniform Statutory Form Power of
Attorney Act. The language has been
revised where necessary to reflect
modern custom and practice. Where
significant changes have been made,
they are noted in a comment to the
relevant section. In general, there are
two important differences between
the statutory treatment of authority in
this Act and in the Uniform Statutory
Form Power of Attorney Act. First, this
Act includes a section that provides a
default rule for the parameters of gift
making authority (Section 15-14-740).
Second, this Act identifies specific
acts that may be authorized only by an
express grant in the power of attorney
(Section 15-14-724(1)). Express
authorization for the acts listed in
Section 15-14-724(1) is required
because of the risk those acts pose to
the principal's property and estate
plan. The purpose of Section 15-14-724(1) is to make clear that authority
for these acts may not be inferred
from a grant of general authority.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">OFFICIAL GENERAL COMMENT</SPAN></P>

<MULTICOL COLS="2" WIDTH="553" GUTTER="46">

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	Subpart 3 provides a concise,
optional statutory form for creating a
power of attorney under this Act
(Section 15-14-741). With the
proliferation of power of attorney
forms in the public domain, the
advantage of a statutorily-sanctioned
form is the promotion of uniformity in
power of attorney practice. In states
such as Illinois and New York, where
state- sanctioned statutory forms
have existed for many years, the
statutory form is widely used by both
lawyers and lay persons. The
familiarity and common understanding
achieved with the use of one statutory
form also facilitates acceptance of
powers of attorney. In the twenty
years preceding this Act, the number
of states with statutory forms has
increased from only a few to eighteen.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	In addition to the statutory form
powerof attorney, Subpart 3 provides
an optional form for agent
certification of facts pertaining to a
power of attorney (Section 15-14-
742). Pursuant to Section 15-14-719, a
person may request an agent to
certify any factual matter concerning
the principal, agent, or power of
attorney. The form in Section 15-14-742 is intended to facilitate agent
compliance with these requests. The
form lists factual matters about which
persons commonly request
certification (<EM>e.g.</EM>, the principal is alive
and has not revoked the power of
attorney or the agent's authority), and
provides a designated space for
certification of additional factual
statements. Both the statutory form
power of attorney and the agent
certification form may be tailored to
accommodate individual
circumstances and objectives.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">SUPPORTED DECISION-MAKING AGREEMENTS FOR</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">ADULTS WITH A DISABILITY</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-14-801.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly finds and
declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  Guardianship constitutes one of the most restrictive options available to
adults with disabilities and their families;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  Guardianship should be employed only when a less restrictive alternative
would fail to meet the needs of the adult with a disability;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(c)  Adults with disabilities are presumed competent and have the capacity to
facilitate the exercise of decisions regarding their day-to-day health, safety,
welfare, or financial affairs, unless otherwise determined through legal
proceedings;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(d)  Supported decision-making, as defined in section 15-14-802 (5), offers
adults with disabilities a voluntary method of decision-making that, as appropriate,
may also be used concurrently with, but subject to, an existing guardianship,
conservatorship, or power of attorney;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(e)  Supported decision-making facilitates adults with disabilities in
maintaining decision-making authority over their own lives while also encouraging
these adults to recognize, create, and maintain supportive communities, through
supported decision-making teams, that can assist adults with disabilities in making
informed decisions;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(f)  Adults with disabilities should have access to opportunities to experience
and practice decision-making skills;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(g)  Adults with disabilities who do not have a court-appointed guardian or a
court-appointed conservator have the right to independently make any decision
without any member of the supportive community, regardless of having entered
into a supported decision-making agreement; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(h)  Supported decision-making agreements do not:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(I)  Create a fiduciary or contractual relationship between an adult with a
disability and a member of the supportive community;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(II)  Elevate a member of the supportive community to a person in a position
of trust in regard to the adult with a disability based solely on the member of the
supportive community's involvement in the supported decision-making agreement;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(III)  Alter, diminish, or supersede the terms of a court-ordered guardianship
or conservatorship. A guardian or conservator has the right, if authorized by the
court, to determine if a ward or protected person may enter into or continue a
supported decision-making agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(IV)  Authorize a member of the supportive community to obtain or use
personal, financial, or confidential information of the adult with a disability for the
member of the supportive community's own purpose or benefit, or for the purpose
or benefit of a third-party; or</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(V)  Shield a member of the supportive community from criminal or civil
liability for acts that would otherwise be subject to civil or criminal liability,
notwithstanding section 15-14-806 (2); and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(i)  In addition to supported decision-making, adults with disabilities should
have a variety of formal and informal processes available to make decisions and
express preferences of choices, including but not limited to medical and financial
powers of attorney, guardianship, limited guardianship, conservatorship, special
conservatorship, release of information forms, and representative payees.</SPAN></P>

a disability may voluntarily, without undue influence or coercion, enter into a
supported decision-making agreement with one or more members of the supportive
community. The supported decision-making agreement does not adversely affect
the decision-making authority granted to a court-appointed guardian or court-appointed conservator. Under the agreement, the adult with a disability may
request the member of the supportive community to do any or all of the following:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  Provide supported decision-making, including assistance in
understanding the options, responsibilities, and consequences of the adult's life
decisions, without making those decisions on behalf of the adult with a disability;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  Pursuant to section 15-14-804 and at the specific request of the adult
with a disability, assist the adult with a disability in accessing, collecting, obtaining,
and understanding information that is relevant to a given life decision from any
person, including but not limited to medical, psychological, financial, educational,
occupational, and social decisions; treatment records; how and in what
relationships the adult with a disability chooses to engage; and information about
how a supportive community is chosen; or</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(c)  Assist the adult with a disability in communicating the adult's decisions to
appropriate persons when expressly requested by the adult with a disability.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  A member of the supportive community shall not be entitled to
compensation or other consideration, in cash or in kind, for assistance provided to
the adult with a disability for the purposes of a supportive decision-making
agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(3) (a)  The supported decision-making agreement is effective until
terminated by either the adult with a disability or the member of the supportive
community, or by the terms of the agreement. Any party may choose to terminate
the agreement at any point by providing written or verbal notice of the termination
to all parties to the supported decision-making agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  The supported decision-making agreement is automatically terminated if:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">PROVISIONS RELATING TO EFFECT OF DEATH</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans "> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-15-101.  Nonprobate transfers on death. </STRONG>(1)  A provision for a nonprobate
transfer on death in an insurance policy, contract of employment, bond, mortgage,
promissory note, certificated or uncertificated security, account agreement,
custodial agreement, deposit agreement, compensation plan, pension plan,
individual retirement plan, employee benefit plan, trust, conveyance, deed of gift,
marital property agreement, or other written instrument of a similar nature is
nontestamentary. This subsection (1) includes a written provision that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  Money or other benefits due to, controlled by, or owned by a decedent
before death must be paid after the decedent's death to a person whom the
decedent designates either in the instrument or in a separate writing, including a
will, executed either before or at the same time as the instrument, or later;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  Money due or to become due under the instrument ceases to be payable
in the event of death of the promisee or the promisor before payment or demand; or</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(c)  Any property controlled by or owned by the decedent before death which
is the subject of the instrument passes to a person the decedent designates either
in the instrument or in a separate writing, including a will, executed either before or
at the same time as the instrument, or later.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(1.5)  A conveyance or deed of gift described in subsection (1) of this section
that relates to an interest in real property may be created pursuant to part 4 of this
article and, if so created, shall be subject to the rights of third parties described in
part 4 of this article.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  Under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, it is permissible to
designate as a beneficiary, payee, or owner a trustee named in an inter vivos or
testamentary trust in existence at the date of such designation. It is not necessary
to the validity of any such trust that there be in existence a trust corpus other than
the right to receive the benefits or to exercise the rights resulting from such a
designation. It is also permissible to designate as a beneficiary, payee, or owner a
trustee named in, or ascertainable under, the will of the designator. The benefits or
rights resulting from such a designation shall be payable or transferable to the
trustee upon admission of the will to probate if a testamentary trustee is the
designated payee or transferee, subject to the right of the payer to impose
requirements and take actions as may a personal representative acting under
section 15-12-913. A trustee shall not be disqualified to receive such benefits or
rights merely because the trust under which he was to act or is acting fails to come
into existence or has been distributed in part or whole, but such a trustee shall
receive and distribute the proceeds in accord with the terms of such trust.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(3)  If a trustee is designated pursuant to subsection (2) of this section and no
qualified trustee makes claim to the benefits or rights resulting from such a
designation within one year after the death of the designator, or if evidence
satisfactory to the person obligated to make the payment or transfer is furnished
within such one-year period that there is or will be no trustee to receive the
proceeds, payment or transfer shall be made to the personal representative of the
designator, unless otherwise provided by such designation or other controlling
agreement made during the lifetime of the designator.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(4)  The payment of the benefits due or a transfer of the rights given under a
designation pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) of this section and the receipt for such
payment or transfer executed by the trustee or other authorized payee thereof
shall constitute a full discharge and acquittance of the person obligated to make
the payment or transfer.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(5)  Payment of the benefits due or the transfer of the rights given in
accordance with a designation under the provisions of subsection (2) of this section
shall not cause such benefits or rights to be included in the property administered
as part of the designator's estate under this code or to be subject to the claims of
his or her creditors, except as provided in part 2 of article 11 of this title and in
section 15-15-103.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(6)  Except as otherwise provided in part 2 of article 11 of this title and in
section 15-15-103, the express provisions of the trust agreement, declaration of
trust, or testamentary trust shall control and regulate the extent to which the
benefits or rights payable or transferable under such a designation shall be subject
to the debts of the designator if paid or transferred under the provisions of
subsection (2) of this section.</SPAN></P>

the admission to probate of such will and without regard to whether such will was
executed before or after the creation of the joint tenancy.</SPAN></P>

to 1990.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-15-103.  Liability of nonprobate transferees for creditor claims and
statutory allowances. </STRONG>(1) (a)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this
subsection (1), as used in this section, nonprobate transfer means a valid transfer
effective at death by a transferor whose last domicile was in this state to the extent
that the transferor immediately before death had power, acting alone, to prevent
the transfer by revocation or withdrawal and instead to use the property for the
benefit of the transferor or apply it to discharge claims against the transferor's
probate estate.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  This section shall not apply to:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(I)  A survivorship interest in joint tenancy real estate; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(II)  Property transferred by the exercise or default in the exercise of a power
of appointment, including a power of withdrawal, created by a person other than
the transferor; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(III)  Proceeds transferred pursuant to a beneficiary designation under a life
insurance, accident insurance, or annuity policy contract; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(IV)  Property or funds held in or payable from a pension or retirement plan,
individual retirement account, deferred compensation plan, internal revenue code
section 529 plan, or other similar arrangement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this
section, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is subject to liability to any probate
estate of the decedent for allowed claims against the decedent's probate estate
and statutory allowances to the decedent's spouse and children to the extent the
estate is insufficient to satisfy those claims and allowances. The liability of a
nonprobate transferee may not exceed the value of nonprobate transfers received
or controlled by that transferee.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(3)  Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency described in
subsection (2) of this section in the following order of priority:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  A transferee designated in the decedent's will or any other governing
instrument, as provided in the instrument;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  The trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate instrument in
the decedent's estate plan as shown by its designation as devisee of the decedent's
residuary estate or by other acts or circumstances, to the extent of the value of the
nonprobate transfer received or controlled;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(c)  Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values received.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(4)  Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, interests of
beneficiaries in all trusts incurring liabilities under this section abate as necessary
to satisfy the liability, as if all of the trust instruments were a single will and the
interests were devisees under that will.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(5)  A provision made in one instrument may direct the apportionment of the
liability among the nonprobate transferees taking under that or any other governing
instrument. If a provision in one instrument conflicts with a provision in another
instrument, the provision of the later instrument shall prevail.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(6)  Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability imposed by this
section is enforceable in proceedings in this state, whether or not the transferee is
located in this state.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(7)  A proceeding under this section may not be commenced unless the
personal representative of the decedent's estate has received a written demand for
the proceeding from the decedent's surviving spouse or a child of the decedent, to
the extent that statutory allowances are affected, or a creditor. If the personal
representative declines or fails to commence a proceeding after demand, a person
making demand may commence the proceeding in the name of the decedent's
estate, at the expense of the person making the demand and not of the estate. A
personal representative who declines in good faith to commence a requested
proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(8)  A proceeding under this section shall be commenced within one year
after the decedent's death, but a proceeding on behalf of a creditor whose claim
was allowed after proceedings challenging disallowance of the claim may be
commenced within sixty-three days after final allowance of the claim.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(9)  Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent's probate estate is
nonexistent or insufficient to pay allowed claims and statutory allowances has been
received from the decedent's personal representative, the following rules apply:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  Payment or delivery of assets by a financial institution, registrar, or other
obligor to a nonprobate transferee in accordance with the terms of the governing
instrument controlling the transfer releases the obligor from all claims for amounts
paid or assets delivered.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  A trustee receiving or controlling a nonprobate transfer is released from
liability under this section with respect to any assets distributed to the trust's
beneficiaries. Each beneficiary, to the extent of the distribution received, becomes
liable for the amount of the trustee's liability attributable to assets received by the
beneficiary.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(10)  The receipt of funds derived from nonprobate transferees by a person as
provided in this section in satisfaction of such person's claim for a debt or statutory
allowances does not constitute the receipt of nonprobate property by such person
for purposes of this section or part 2 of article 11 of this title.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(11)  In the event of any conflict in the provisions of this section with the
provisions of parts 2 and 4 of article 11 of this title, the provisions of this section
shall control.</SPAN></P>

of a party means the sum of all deposits to an account made by or for the party, less

or applied to the use of another party and a proportionate share of any charges
deducted from the account, plus a proportionate share of any interest or dividends

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-15-212.  Rights at death. </STRONG>(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this section,
on death of a party sums on deposit in a multiple-party account belong to the
surviving party or parties. If two or more parties survive and one is the surviving
spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before
death, was beneficially entitled under section 15-15-211 belongs to the surviving
spouse. If two or more parties survive and none is the surviving spouse of the
decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was
beneficially entitled under section 15-15-211 belongs to the surviving parties in
equal shares, and augments the proportion to which each survivor, immediately
before the decedent's death, was beneficially entitled under section 15-15-211, and
the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  In an account with a POD designation:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  On death of one of two or more parties, the rights in sums on deposit are
governed by subsection (1).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b) (I)  On death of the sole party or the last survivor of two or more parties,
sums on deposit belong to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries. If two or more
beneficiaries survive, sums on deposit belong to them in such proportions as
specified in the POD designation or, if the POD designation does not specify
different proportions, in equal and undivided shares; and there is no right of
survivorship in the event of death of a beneficiary thereafter.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(II)  If there are two or more beneficiaries, and if any beneficiary fails to
survive the sole party or the last survivor of two or more parties, sums on deposit
belong to the surviving beneficiaries in proportion to their respective interests as
beneficiaries under subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (b).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(III)  If no beneficiary survives, sums on deposit belong to the estate of the
last surviving party.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(IV)  Neither the provisions of section 15-11-706 nor the provisions of any
other anti-lapse statute apply to the disposition of an account with a POD
designation.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(3)  Sums on deposit in a single-party account without a POD designation, or
in a multiple-party account that, by the terms of the account, is without right of
survivorship, are not affected by death of a party, but the amount to which the
decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under section 15-15-211 is transferred as part of the decedent's estate. A POD designation in a multiple-party account without right of survivorship is ineffective. For purposes of this
section, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the
account is without right of survivorship.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(4)  The ownership right of a surviving party or beneficiary, or of the
decedent's estate, in sums on deposit is subject to requests for payment made by a
party before the party's death, whether paid by the financial institution before or
after death, or unpaid. The surviving party or beneficiary, or the decedent's estate,
is liable to the payee of an unpaid request for payment. The liability is limited to a
proportionate share of the amount transferred under this section, to the extent
necessary to discharge the request for payment.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(5)  Sums remaining on deposit at the death of a party to a multiple-party
account, which are not subject to a POD designation, belong to the surviving party
or parties as against the estate of the decedent unless there is clear and convincing
evidence of a different intention.</SPAN></P>

person with the right to act as a proxy decision-maker in a designated beneficiary

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(1.5)  As used in this section:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  Interested person means a patient's spouse, either parent of the
patient, any adult child, sibling, or grandchild of the patient, or any close friend of
the patient.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  The determination that an adult patient lacks decisional capacity to
provide informed consent to or refusal of medical treatment may be made by a
court or the attending physician, and the determination shall be documented in
such patient's medical record. The determination may also be made by an advanced
practice registered nurse who has collaborated about the patient with a licensed
physician either in person, by telephone, or electronically. The advanced practice
registered nurse shall document in the patient's record the name of the physician
with whom the advanced practice registered nurse collaborated. The attending
physician shall make specific findings regarding the cause, nature, and projected
duration of the patient's lack of decisional capacity, which findings shall be
included in the patient's medical record.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(3)  Upon a determination that an adult patient lacks decisional capacity to
provide informed consent to or refusal of medical treatment, the attending
physician, the advanced practice registered nurse, or such physician's or nurse's
designee, shall make reasonable efforts to notify the patient of the patient's lack of
decisional capacity. In addition, the attending physician, or such physician's
designee, shall make reasonable efforts to locate as many interested persons as
practicable, and the attending physician or advanced practice registered nurse may
rely on such individuals to notify other family members or interested persons. Upon
locating an interested person, the attending physician, advanced practice
registered nurse, or such physician's or nurse's designee, shall inform such person
of the patient's lack of decisional capacity and that a proxy decision-maker should
be selected for the patient.</SPAN></P>

capacity shall make reasonable efforts to reach a consensus as to who among them
shall make medical treatment decisions on behalf of the patient. The person
selected to act as the patient's proxy decision-maker should be the person who has
a close relationship with the patient and who is most likely to be currently informed
of the patient's wishes regarding medical treatment decisions. If any of the
interested persons disagrees with the selection or the decision of the proxy
decision-maker or, if, after reasonable efforts, the interested persons are unable to
reach a consensus as to who should act as the proxy decision-maker, then any of
the interested persons may seek guardianship of the patient by initiating

designee cannot locate any interested persons, or no interested person is willing
and able to serve as proxy decision-maker;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(B)  The attending physician has obtained an independent determination of
the patient's lack of decisional capacity by another physician; by an advanced
practice registered nurse who has collaborated about the patient with a licensed
physician either in person, by telephone, or electronically; or by a court;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(C)  The attending physician or his or her designee has consulted with and
obtained a consensus on the proxy designation with the medical ethics committee

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(D)  The identity of the physician designated as proxy decision-maker is
documented in the medical record.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(II)  For the purposes of subsections (4)(c)(I)(C), (4)(c)(V)(B), and (4)(c)(V)(C) of

the facility shall refer the attending physician or his or her designee to a medical
ethics committee at another health-care facility.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(III)  The authority of the proxy decision-maker terminates in the event that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(A)  An interested person is willing to serve as proxy decision-maker;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(B)  A guardian is appointed;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(C)  The patient regains decisional capacity;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(D)  The proxy decision-maker decides to no longer serve as the patient's
proxy decision-maker; or</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(E)  The patient is transferred or discharged from the facility, if any, where
the patient is receiving care, unless the proxy decision-maker expresses his or her
intention to continue to serve as proxy decision-maker.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(IV)  If the authority of a proxy decision-maker terminates for one of the
reasons described in subparagraph (III) of this paragraph (c), the attending
physician shall document the reason in the patient's medical record.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(V)  The attending physician and the proxy decision-maker shall adhere to the
following guidelines for proxy decision-making:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(A)  For routine treatments and procedures that are low-risk and within
broadly accepted standards of medical practice, the attending physician may make
health-care treatment decisions;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(B)  For treatments that otherwise require a written, informed consent, such
as treatments involving anesthesia, treatments involving a significant risk of
complication, or invasive procedures, the attending physician shall obtain the
written consent of the proxy decision-maker and a consensus with the medical
ethics committee;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(C)  For end-of-life treatment that is nonbeneficial and involves withholding
or withdrawing specific medical treatments, the attending physician shall obtain an
independent concurring opinion from a physician other than the proxy decision-maker, and obtain a consensus with the medical ethics committee.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(5)  When an attending physician determines that an adult patient lacks
decisional capacity, the attending physician or another health-care provider shall
make reasonable efforts to advise the patient of such determination, of the identity
of the proxy decision-maker, and of the patient's right to object, pursuant to section
15-14-506 (4)(a).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(6) (a)  Artificial nourishment and hydration may be withheld or withdrawn
from a patient upon a decision of a proxy only when the attending physician and a
second independent physician trained in neurology or neurosurgery certify in the
patient's medical record that the provision or continuation of artificial nourishment
or hydration is merely prolonging the act of dying and is unlikely to result in the
restoration of the patient to independent neurological functioning.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b) (I)  Nothing in this article may be construed as condoning, authorizing, or
approving euthanasia or mercy killing.</SPAN></P>

deliberate act to end a person's life, except to permit natural death as provided by
this article.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(6.5)  The assistance of a health-care facility's medical ethics committee
shall be provided upon the request of a proxy decision-maker or any other
interested person whenever the proxy decision-maker is considering or has made a
decision to withhold or withdraw medical treatment. If there is no medical ethics
committee for a health-care facility, such facility may provide an outside referral
for such assistance or consultation.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(7)  If any interested person or the guardian or the attending physician
believes the patient has regained decisional capacity, then the attending physician
shall reexamine the patient and determine whether the patient has regained such
decisional capacity and shall enter the decision and the basis therefore into the
patient's medical record and shall notify the patient, the proxy decision-maker, and
the person who initiated the redetermination of decisional capacity.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(8)  Except for a court acting on its own motion, a governmental entity,
including the state department of human services and the county departments of
human or social services, may not petition the court as an interested person
pursuant to part 3 of article 14 of this title 15. In addition, nothing in this article 18.5
authorizes the county director of any county department of human or social
services, or designee of such director, to petition the court pursuant to section 26-3.1-104 in regard to any patient subject to the provisions of this article 18.5.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(9) (a)  Any attending physician, health-care provider, or health-care facility
that makes reasonable attempts to locate and communicate with a proxy decision-maker shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or regulatory sanction
therefor.</SPAN></P>

with paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of this section is not subject to civil or criminal
liability or regulatory sanction for acting as a proxy decision-maker. An attending
physician or his or her designee remains responsible for his or her negligent acts or
omissions in rendering care to an unrepresented patient.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">PART 1</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">DIRECTIVES CONCERNING MEDICAL ORDERS</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans "> FOR SCOPE OF TREATMENT</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-18.7-101.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly hereby finds
that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  Colorado law has traditionally recognized the right of an adult or his or
her authorized surrogate decision-maker to accept or reject medical treatment and
artificial nutrition or hydration;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  Each adult has the right to establish, in advance of the need for medical
treatment, directives and instructions for the administration of medical treatment in
the event the adult later lacks the decisional capacity to provide informed consent
to, withdraw from, or refuse medical treatment;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(c)  Current instruments for making advance medical directives are often
underutilized, hampered by certain institutional barriers, and inconsistently
interpreted and implemented; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(d)  The frail elderly, chronically or terminally ill, and nursing home resident
population is in particular need of a consistent method for identifying and
communicating critical treatment preferences that each sector of the health-care
community will recognize and follow.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  The general assembly therefore concludes that it is in the best interests
of the people of Colorado to adopt statutes providing for medical orders for scope
of treatment. Consistent with the goal of enhancing patient-centered,
compassionate care through methods to enhance continuity across health-care
settings, medical orders for scope of treatment will provide a process for timely
discussion between individuals and their health-care providers about choices to
accept, withdraw, or refuse life-sustaining treatment and, through the use of
standardized forms, will ensure those preferences are clearly and unequivocally
documented.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-19-223.  Facilitation of anatomical gift from decedent whose body is
under jurisdiction of coroner. </STRONG>(a)  Upon request of a procurement organization, a
coroner shall release to the procurement organization the name, contact
information, and available medical and social history of a decedent whose body is
under the jurisdiction of the coroner. If the decedent's body or part is medically
suitable for transplantation or therapy, the coroner shall release post-mortem
examination results to the procurement organization. The procurement organization
may make a subsequent disclosure of the post-mortem examination results or other
information received from the coroner only if relevant to transplantation or therapy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  The coroner may conduct a medicolegal examination by reviewing all
medical records, laboratory test results, X-rays, other diagnostic results, and other
information that any person possesses about a donor or prospective donor whose
body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner which the coroner determines may be
relevant to the investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(c)  A person that has any information requested by a coroner pursuant to
subsection (b) of this section shall provide that information as expeditiously as
possible to allow the coroner to conduct the medicolegal investigation within a
period compatible with the preservation of parts for the purpose of transplantation
or therapy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(d)  If an anatomical gift has been or might be made of a part of a decedent
whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner and a post-mortem examination
is not required, or the coroner determines that a post-mortem examination is
required but that the recovery of the part that is the subject of an anatomical gift
will not interfere with the examination, the coroner and procurement organization
shall cooperate in the timely removal of the part from the decedent for the purpose
of transplantation or therapy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(e)  If an anatomical gift of a part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of
the coroner has been or might be made, but the coroner initially believes that the
recovery of the part could interfere with the post-mortem investigation into the
decedent's cause or manner of death or preservation or collection of evidence, the
coroner shall consult with the procurement organization or physician or technician
designated by the procurement organization about the proposed recovery. The
procurement organization shall obtain and provide the coroner with all available
information which could relate to the cause or manner of the decedent's death.
After consultation, the coroner may allow the recovery, or may deny or delay the
recovery as provided in subsection (f), (g), or (h) of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(f)  The coroner, district attorney, and a procurement organization shall enter
into an agreement establishing protocols and procedures governing the relations
between them when an anatomical gift of a part from a decedent whose body is
under the jurisdiction of the coroner has been or might be made but the coroner or
the district attorney believes that the recovery of the part could interfere with the
post-mortem investigation into the decedent's cause or manner of death or the
documentation or preservation of evidence. Decisions regarding the recovery of the
part from the decedent shall be made in accordance with the agreement. The
coroner, district attorney, and procurement organization shall evaluate the
effectiveness of the agreement at regular intervals but no less frequently than
every two years.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(g)  In the absence of an agreement as provided in subsection (f) of this
section that establishes protocols and procedures governing the relations between
the coroner, district attorney, and procurement organization when an anatomical
gift of an organ from a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner
has been or might be made, and following the consultation under subsection (e) of
this section, if the coroner intends to deny recovery of the organ, the coroner or
designee, at the request of the procurement organization, shall view the body either
at the hospital or recovery location or by electronic means, prior to making a
decision whether or not to allow the procurement organization to recover the organ.
After viewing the body, the coroner or designee may allow recovery by the
procurement organization to proceed, or, if the coroner or designee reasonably
believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent's cause or
manner of death or preservation or collection of evidence, deny recovery by the
procurement organization. The coroner or designee shall comply with all the
requirements of this section in a manner and within a time period compatible with
the preservation and purposes of the organ.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(h)  In the absence of an agreement establishing protocols and procedures
governing the relations between the coroner, district attorney, and procurement
organization when an anatomical gift of an eye or tissues from a decedent whose
body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner has been or might be made, and
following the consultation under subsection (e) of this section, the coroner may
allow, deny, or delay the recovery of the eye or tissues until after the collection of
evidence or autopsy, in order to preserve and collect evidence, to maintain a proper
chain-of-custody, or to allow an accurate determination of the decedent's cause of
death. When a determination to delay the recovery of the eye or tissues is made,
every effort possible shall be made by the coroner to complete the collection of
evidence or autopsy in a timely manner compatible with the preservation of the eye
or tissues for the purpose of transplantation or therapy.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(i)  If the coroner or designee denies or delays recovery under subsection (f),
(g), or (h) of this section, the coroner or designee shall:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(1)  State in a record the specific reasons for not allowing recovery of the
part;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  Include the specific reasons in the records of the coroner; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(3)  Upon request by a procurement organization, provide a record within two
weeks of the date of the request with the specific reasons for not allowing recovery
of the part.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(j)  If the coroner or designee allows recovery of a part, in addition to any
information required pursuant to the protocol under subsection (f) of this section,
the procurement organization shall cooperate with the coroner in any
documentation of injuries and the preservation and collection of evidence prior to
and during the recovery of the part and, upon the coroner's request, shall cause the
physician or technician who removes the part to provide the coroner, as soon as
practicable, with a record that includes: The names of all personnel participating in
the removal of the part; a report documenting any internal or external injuries
observed, any evidence observed, and describing the condition of the part;
photographs or other documentation of evidence as identified in the protocol; and
any other information and observations that would assist in the post mortem.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(k)  If a coroner or designee is required to be present to view the body at the
hospital or recovery location under subsection (g) of this section, upon request the
procurement organization requesting the recovery of the part shall reimburse the
coroner or designee for the reasonable additional cost of travel incurred in
complying with subsection (g) of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-19-302.  Duty of public officers as to unclaimed bodies. </STRONG>(1)  All public
officers, agents, and servants, and all officers, agents, and servants of every
county, city, township, borough, district, and other municipality, and every
almshouse, prison, morgue, hospital, or other municipal or other public institution,
and all other persons having charge or control over unclaimed dead human bodies
required to be buried at public expense shall use reasonable effort to ascertain if
the deceased person has any relative, friend, or other representative who will
assume charge of the body for burial at his or her expense. If the effort does not
result in the discovery of a claimant within twenty-four hours after death, the
officers, agents, or other persons shall immediately notify the anatomical board or
such person as may from time to time be designated by the board as its duly
authorized officer or agent, when such unclaimed body or bodies come into his or
her possession, charge, or control. In any county that is entirely located more than
one hundred fifty miles from any accredited medical or dental school, the minimum
period of notification shall be extended to forty-eight hours. The officers, agents, or
other persons, without fee or reward, shall deliver the unclaimed body to the
anatomical board and permit the board or its agents to take and remove all the
unclaimed bodies to be used for the advancement of medical and anatomical
sciences.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  Notice shall be given to the anatomical board in all cases, but the body
must not be delivered if any relative, by blood or marriage, has previously claimed
the body for burial at the expense of the relative, in which case the body must be
surrendered to the claimant for interment. Further, the body must not be delivered
if any representative of a fraternal society of which the deceased was a member, or
a representative of any charitable organization, or if any friend of the deceased
indigent person claims the body for burial prior to delivery to the board, with the
burial at the expense of the fraternal society, charitable organization, or friend. In
the case of death of any person whose body is required to be buried at public
expense and the duly authorized officer or agent of the anatomical board deems
the body unfit for anatomical purposes, he or she shall notify the board of county
commissioners or agency in charge of indigent persons in the county in which the
person dies, in writing, and the board of county commissioners or agency shall
direct a person to take charge of the body of the deceased indigent person, and
cause it to be buried, and draw warrants upon the treasurer of the county for the
payment of expenses.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(3)  Warrants for the payment of the expenses of the burial of any person
whose body is required to be buried at public expense must not be drawn or paid
except upon the certificate of the duly authorized officer or agent of the anatomical
board to the effect that the unclaimed body is unfit for anatomical purposes due to
decomposition or contagious disease, and that the provisions of this part 3 have
been complied with. If, through the failure of any person to deliver the body of a
deceased indigent person as required by this part 3, the unclaimed body is unfit for
anatomical purposes, and is certified as unfit by the duly authorized officer or agent
of the anatomical board, the body must be buried in accordance with the provisions
of this part 3, and the person who failed to deliver the unclaimed body shall pay to
the county treasurer the expenses incurred. Upon the refusal or failure of the
person, on demand, to pay the expenses, the board of county commissioners, or
such other agency as may be in charge of indigent persons in the county, may bring
suit to recover the expenses, and the expenses may be recovered as debts
collectible by law.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-22-101.  Short title. </STRONG>This article shall be known and may be cited as the
Colorado Designated Beneficiary Agreement Act.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>Source:</STRONG> <STRONG>L. 2009:</STRONG> Entire article added, (HB 09-1260), ch. 107, p. 428, § 1,
effective July 1.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	<STRONG>15-22-102.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly finds and
determines that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  Not all Coloradans are adequately protected by the provisions of the
Colorado Probate Code, articles 10 to 17 of this title, and other provisions of
Colorado law. Current state and federal laws present impediments and
disincentives for people wishing to avail themselves of the protections of this title.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  Beyond legal impediments, people often fail to plan for their own
mortality. Studies have found that significant numbers of Americans do not have a
valid will, and even fewer have executed powers of attorney or other estate
planning documents.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(c)  A body of law has been enacted to operate by default in situations in
which individuals do not prepare estate plans. However, failure to plan for disability,
incapacity, or death places people at the mercy of state laws that may vest the
power to act in such situations in persons other than those they would wish to have
exercise those powers. Many lack access to legal services due to the expense of
drafting legal instruments and the necessity to keep these documents current.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(d)  The power of individuals to care for one another and take action to be
personally responsible for themselves and their loved ones is of tremendous
societal benefit, enabling self-determination and reducing reliance on public
programs and services.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  Therefore, the general assembly declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(a)  The public policy of the state should encourage residents to execute
appropriate legal documents to effectuate their wishes;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  The purposes of this article are to:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(I)  Make existing laws relating to health care, medical emergencies,
incapacity, death, and administration of decedent's estates available to more
persons through a process of documenting designated beneficiary agreements; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(II)  Allow individuals to elect to have certain default provisions in state
statutes provide rights, benefits, and protections to a designated beneficiary in
situations in which no valid and enforceable estate planning documents exist.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(c)  It is the intent of the general assembly that this article be liberally
construed to give effect to the purposes stated in this article.</SPAN></P>

designated beneficiary agreement pursuant to this article.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(2)  Designated beneficiary agreement means an agreement that is entered
into pursuant to this article by two people for the purpose of designating each

each person has certain rights and financial protections based upon the
designation.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(3)  Superseding legal document means a legal document, regardless of
the date of execution, that is valid and enforceable and conflicts with all or a
portion of a designated beneficiary agreement and, therefore, causes the
designated beneficiary agreement in whole or in part to be replaced or set aside. To
the extent there is a conflict between a superseding legal document and a
designated beneficiary agreement, the superseding legal document controls. A
superseding legal document may include, but need not be limited to, any of the

department;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans ">	(b)  The judicial department should maintain the electronic record of each
