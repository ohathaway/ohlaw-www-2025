organizations, which are the state's primary transportation planning entities with
responsibility for selecting and funding transportation capacity projects, to engage
in an enhanced level of planning, modeling and other analysis, community

the commission for its review implementing procedures and guidelines that require
the department and metropolitan planning organizations to take additional steps in
the planning process for regionally significant transportation capacity projects to
account for the impacts on the amount of statewide greenhouse gas pollution and
statewide vehicle miles traveled that are expected to result from such projects.
Such guidelines and procedures shall apply to adoption of the next ten-year plan
and subsequent planning cycles and shall fully evaluate the potential
environmental and health impacts on disproportionately impacted communities.
The commission shall, with such modifications as the commission may make subject
to the requirements of this section and with opportunities for public involvement,
adopt the procedures and guidelines. At a minimum, both the proposed and adopted
procedures and guidelines must require the department and metropolitan planning
organizations to:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Implement relevant rules and regulations issued pursuant to section 25-7-105;</SPAN></P>

analytical scrutiny is given to greenhouse gas pollutants as is given to other air
pollutants of concern in the state including consideration of the impact on
emissions of greenhouse gas pollutants of induced demand resulting from
regionally significant transportation capacity projects alongside traffic modeling;
and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Consider the role of land use in the transportation planning process and
develop strategies to encourage land use decisions that reduce vehicle miles
traveled and greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>

project, as determined by the department with consideration given to federal law or
regulations that define or describe such projects, the department shall, through its
environmental study process:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Use federal environmental protection agency-approved models to
determine air pollutant emission impacts for the planned project and provide
monitoring and measurement of criteria pollutants prior to construction;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Develop and implement a particulate matter construction plan to provide
continuous monitoring and transparent public reporting of concentrations, public
alerts issued as soon as possible when exceedance events occur, and action plans
to address emission levels on construction projects prior to exceedances, with
particular focus on disproportionately impacted communities; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Develop and implement a plan to mitigate air quality impacts on
communities, including but not limited to disproportionately impacted communities
adjacent to the project, with particular focus where feasible on mitigation of fine
particulate matter pollution.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  With the exception of the interstate highway 270 corridor improvement
project, the requirements of subsections (4)(a) and (4)(c) of this section do not apply

planning, and implementation in communities, including but not limited to
disproportionately impacted communities, the department shall, with opportunity
for public input, review, update, and improve as necessary its public engagement
program for planned transportation capacity projects. In doing so, the department
shall create diverse and impactful ways to gather input from communities across
the state by communicating in multiple languages and multiple formats and
transparently sharing readily understandable information about potential adverse
impacts, including but not limited to environmental and health impacts, of potential
transportation capacity projects.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>43-1-136.  Statewide transit pass exploratory committee - legislative
declaration - definitions. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a) (I) Over-reliance on personal passenger vehicles for transportation
contributes to poor air quality and climate change and has a negative economic
impact on families in the state;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II) (A)  Nationwide, the number of jobs within the typical commute distance
for residents in major metropolitan areas has declined over time according to a
report by the Brookings Institution titled The Growing Distance Between People
and Jobs in Metropolitan America;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(B)  Coloradans drive more miles per person than they used to, in part due to
stress on transportation infrastructure and increasing household costs; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(C)  Since 1981, per capita vehicle miles traveled in Colorado have risen by
over twenty percent according to data from the federal highway administration;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  High transportation costs impact low-income households in particular,
with households making less than forty thousand dollars per year in the western
United States spending over twenty-four percent of their income on transportation,
when spending more than fifteen percent of income on transportation is considered
cost burdened, according to data from the bureau of labor statistics consumer
expenditure surveys;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(IV) (A)  In addition to economic impacts, the increase in vehicle traffic has an
environmental impact;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(B)  The United States environmental protection agency has classified the
Denver metro/north front range area as being in severe nonattainment for ozone
and ground level ozone, which has serious impacts on human health, particularly for
vulnerable populations;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(C)  According to the greenhouse gas pollution reduction roadmap, published
by the Colorado energy office and dated January 14, 2021, the transportation sector
is the single largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in Colorado;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(D)  Nearly sixty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions from the
transportation sector come from light-duty vehicles, which constitute the majority
of cars and trucks that Coloradans drive every day;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(E)  As part of the greenhouse gas pollution reduction roadmap, a strategic
action plan to achieve legislatively adopted targets of reducing greenhouse gas
pollution economy-wide by fifty percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and ninety
percent by 2050, the state committed to reducing emissions from the
transportation sector by forty-one percent by 2030 from a 2005 baseline; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(F)  The greenhouse gas transportation planning standard adopted by the
transportation commission in 2021 set a target to reduce transportation greenhouse
gas emissions through the transportation planning process by one million five
hundred thousand tons by 2030;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The general assembly further finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  The environmental and economic issues that result from increased
reliance on passenger vehicles and an increase in the number of miles traveled per
person is a matter of statewide concern;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  One of the key findings of the greenhouse gas pollution reduction
roadmap is that reducing growth in driving is an important tool to achieve the
state's climate goals and that expanding public transit is an important near-term
action that can help achieve those goals; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  It is the state's responsibility to support programs that reduce the
growth in driving and expand public transit.</SPAN></P>

created in subsection (3) of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Statewide transit pass or pass means a single transit pass on a
universal platform that can be used on transit provided by transit agencies across
the state.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Transit agency means a provider of public transportation, as defined in
49 U.S.C. sec. 5302 (15), as amended.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3) (a)  No later than October 1, 2024, the executive director shall create a
statewide transit pass exploratory committee to produce a viable proposal for the
creation, implementation, and administration of a statewide transit pass. The
committee shall meet as necessary to produce a viable proposal by July 1, 2026,
with the goal of implementing a statewide transit pass by January 1, 2028.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Eight representatives from a diverse group of transit agencies throughout
the state including at least one representative from a transit agency that serves a
rural part of the state that is not a resort community and at least one representative
from a transit agency that serves one or more resort communities;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  One representative of an entity or interest group involved in the

and without compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  In conducting its work and in producing a viable proposal for the creation,
implementation, and administration of a statewide transit pass, the committee shall
consider the following:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The logistics of creating a statewide transit pass, including:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  A viable structure for the pass to allow pass holders to use services
provided by transit agencies across the state with a single pass;</SPAN></P>

implement and administer the pass;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  A method for cost-sharing the expenses in connection with the creation,
implementation, administration, and advertisement of the pass;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(IV)  A structure for sharing, apportioning, and distributing revenue from the
sale of the pass among the transit agencies that participate in the pass; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(V)  The possibility of creating a formula to distribute revenue from the sale
of the pass among the transit agencies that participate in the pass, the factors to
consider in the creation of such a formula, and a determination regarding the
frequency with which the formula would be recalculated;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  A method for determining the price of a statewide transit pass, including
whether there will be options for discounted passes for low-income populations and
consideration of how transit operators would continue to collect a fare from the
pass that is consistent with their existing fare structure;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  A structure for the sale of the statewide transit pass to individuals and to
employers for their employees, including:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  An opt-in or opt-out program with a motor vehicle registration or with the
renewal of a driver's license or state identification card issued by the department of
revenue;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Online sales; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  Sales kiosks at airports, train and bus stations, tourism offices, and other

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  The services that will be offered to statewide transit pass holders,
including:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Consideration of whether the pass would cover only services on fixed
routes or provide access-on-demand services in addition to services on fixed routes;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  If access-on-demand services would be included in the pass, how the cost
of those rides factors into the cost of the pass;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  Consideration of the requirements of the federal Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101 et seq., as amended, regarding
accessibility and access to transit; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(IV)  Consideration of federal laws relating to antidiscrimination, including
Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub.L. 88-352, as amended;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  The types of statewide transit passes that would be offered, including
different options for the duration of the pass to accommodate Colorado residents
who may use a pass year-round, for a portion of the year, or for other longer
durations and visitors to Colorado who may use a pass for a day, a week, or another
limited duration;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  Additional opportunities for collaboration across transit agencies in the
state, in addition to the creation, implementation, and administration of a statewide
transit pass, to make it easier and more appealing for people to use transit,
including:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  The possibility of transit agencies allowing customers to purchase a ticket
in one transaction for an entire trip that requires transit services provided by
multiple transit agencies; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  The possibility of transit agencies submitting their trip planning data to a
central source to allow customers to create an itinerary that requires services
provided by multiple transit agencies;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(g)  The technology that would be needed to monitor the use of the statewide
transit pass and track ridership across transit agencies to assist transit agencies in
determining and understanding the financial impact of the pass in the future;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(h)  Any additional local, tribal, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations
that need to be considered in connection with the creation of a statewide transit
pass;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>43-1-1101.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>The general assembly hereby finds and
declares that local government involvement in transportation planning is critical to
the overall statewide transportation planning process. The general assembly
recognizes that regional planning commissions and transportation planning regions
are the proper forum for transportation planning and that the county hearing
process is the proper forum for local government input into the five-year program
of projects. However, the general assembly also recognizes that state involvement
in transportation planning, through the department of transportation, is equally
critical to overall statewide planning, and the general assembly recognizes the
department of transportation as the proper body, in cooperation with regional
planning commissions and local government officials, for developing and
maintaining the state transportation planning process and the state transportation
plan.</SPAN></P>

shall assign greater value to a proposal in proportion to the extent such proposal
commits to using Colorado residents to perform work on the transportation project.

assembly hereby finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The department is authorized by law to use a design-build process for
transportation projects that allows for the improved coordination, scheduling, and
timely performance of transportation projects, resulting in time and cost efficiency;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The scheduling and timely performance of design-build transportation
projects partially depend upon the coordination with utility companies for the
prompt performance of utility relocation work necessitated by the project;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Increased coordination between the department and utility companies is
in the public interest and the encouragement and requirement of prompt
performance of utility relocation work within the design-build transportation
project performance schedule will reduce delays and costs of the projects;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  The preferred approach for utility relocation work in a design-build
transportation project is for the utility company to authorize the department's
design-build contractor to engage the services of the utility company's prequalified
contractors for the design and construction of the relocation work because it
places the responsibility for the timely performance of the utility relocation work on
the design-build contractor and removes the risk of utility relocation delays from
multiple utility companies;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  Current law limits the department's authority in relation to payment for
utility relocation, and nothing in this part 14 is intended to alter the department's
obligation to pay for utility relocations pursuant to section 43-1-225 or to pay for
utility relocations when utility facilities are located on easements owned by the
utility;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  Allowing the department to fund the design of the utility relocation work
necessitated by a design-build transportation project will foster the coordination of
the utility relocation work, which is in the public interest;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(g)  In the interest of the public, the department, the design-build contractor,
and the utility company should coordinate their efforts, perform the utility
relocation work in accordance with the design-build transportation project
performance schedule, and allocate the responsibility for any damages caused by a
party's failure to timely perform the relocation work, except when such failure is
due to a force majeure;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(h)  The review and approval of the utility company of any design work prior
to the commencement of any utility relocation construction in relation to a design-build transportation project will assure that such work meets the quality standards
and construction methods of the utility company. The department also recognizes
the obligation of utility companies to maintain service to their customers, and the
department agrees to work within utility company terms and conditions to maintain
service continuity.</SPAN></P>

relocation of a utility company's facilities if no replacement easement is provided is

the cost incurred by the department for advancing the funds; and</SPAN></P>

for the relocation work and subject to the utility company's prior review and written
approval of the relocation work to assure that the work meets the quality standards
and construction methods of the company. The performance of any relocation work
shall also be subject to inspection and approval by the utility company, during the
performance of the work and prior to completion of the relocation work, and the
department shall take appropriate measures to ensure service continuity.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  It is the intent of the general assembly that the department work with the
utility company to come to a mutually satisfactory agreement with the utility
company so that the design-build transportation project may proceed to be
constructed in an efficient manner without causing interruption of utility services. If
the utility company is unable to reach a project specific utility relocation agreement
with the project manager negotiating such agreement for the department, the
utility company shall be provided the opportunity to address its concerns with the
department's district engineer, who shall give due consideration to all issues raised
by the utility company and shall strive to accommodate reasonable modifications
requested by the utility company to the department's proposed project specific
utility relocation agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached between the
district engineer and the utility company, the executive director of the department
shall review the disputed issues and seek to resolve the dispute. If the executive
director is unable to reach agreement with the utility company, the executive
director shall prepare a written report setting forth the reasons that the dispute
could not be resolved and shall provide such report to the utility company within
three business days.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  For any utility company that chooses not to enter into a project specific
utility relocation agreement with the department for the performance of utility
relocation work:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The department may direct the utility company to perform or allow the
performance of the utility relocation work within the performance schedule for the
design-build transportation project;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The utility company shall pay for damages caused by the company's
delay in the performance of the utility relocation work or interference with the
performance of the design-build transportation project by other contractors,
including, but not limited to, payments made by the department to any third party
based on a claim that performance of the design-build transportation project was
delayed or interfered with as a direct result of the utility company's failure to timely
perform the utility relocation work; except that damages resulting from delays in
the performance of the utility relocation work caused by a force majeure shall not
be charged to the utility company; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  The department may withhold issuance of a permit for the location or
installation of other facilities to a utility company until the company pays the
department damages caused by the company's delay in the performance of the
relocation work or interference with the performance of the design-build
transportation project by any other contractor. Any person aggrieved by an action
of the department in denying a permit may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for appropriate relief pursuant to the Colorado rules of civil procedure
or section 24-4-106, C.R.S.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  The department shall provide written notice to any utility company of a
design-build transportation project that will require the relocation of the company's
facilities as soon as practicable following the environmental clearance for the
project. The notice shall include all available and relevant information concerning
the project, including the performance schedule for the project within which the
utility relocation work must be completed in order to coordinate with and avoid
delay in the performance of the project.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  When feasible, the department shall provide a replacement easement for
a utility company whose facilities are to be relocated from an easement owned by
the utility company to accommodate a design-build transportation project, and the
department shall condemn the replacement easement when necessary. If no
replacement easement is provided, the department shall fund the initial relocation
of the easement owner's facilities and shall also fund all future relocations of those
utility companies whose facilities occupy the easement at the time of the design-build transportation project at the department's sole expense in lieu of
compensating the utility companies for the loss of the easement. The utility
company shall quitclaim to the department that portion of the easement that is
replaced or extinguished.</SPAN></P>

crossing by the landowner, or he must compensate such landowner for any legally
compensable damages sustained by any such severance as provided by law, but the

statewide transportation plan and every five years thereafter if eminent domain is
used by the department of transportation to acquire any part of the right-of-way for

evasion. The civil penalty established by a toll road or toll highway company for any
toll evasion shall be not less than ten dollars nor more than two hundred fifty
dollars, in addition to any costs imposed by a court. A company may use state of the
art technology, including but not limited to automatic vehicle identification
photography, to aid in the collection of tolls and enforcement of toll violations. The
use of state of the art technology to aid in enforcement of toll violations shall be
governed solely by this section.</SPAN></P>

authority to issue civil penalty assessments or municipal summons and complaints
if authorized pursuant to a municipal ordinance for the toll evasion.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  At any time that a person is cited for toll evasion, the person operating
the motor vehicle involved shall be given either a notice in the form of a civil penalty
assessment notice or a municipal summons and complaint. If a civil penalty
assessment is issued, the notice shall be tendered by a peace officer as described
in section 16-2.5-101, C.R.S., and shall contain the name and address of the person,
the license number of the motor vehicle involved, the number of the person's
driver's license, the nature of the violation, the amount of the penalty prescribed for
the violation, the date of the notice, a place for the person to execute a signed
acknowledgment of the person's receipt of the civil penalty assessment notice, a
place for the person to execute a signed acknowledgment of liability for the cited
violation, and such other information as may be required by law to constitute the
notice as a complaint to appear for adjudication of toll evasion pursuant to this

Every cited person shall execute the signed acknowledgment of the person's
receipt of the civil penalty assessment notice.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  The acknowledgment of liability shall be executed at the time the cited
person pays the prescribed penalty. The person cited shall pay the toll, fee, and civil
penalty authorized by the toll road or toll highway company involved at the office of
the company, either in person or by postmarking the payment within twenty days of
the citation. If the person cited does not pay the prescribed toll, fee, and civil
penalty within twenty days of the notice, the civil penalty assessment notice shall
constitute a complaint to appear for adjudication of toll evasion in court or in an
administrative toll enforcement proceeding, and the person cited shall, within the
time specified in the civil penalty assessment notice, file an answer to this
complaint in the manner specified in the notice.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  If a municipal summons and complaint is issued, the adjudication of the
violation shall be conducted and the format of the summons and complaint shall be
determined pursuant to the terms of the municipal ordinance authorizing issuance
of such a summons and complaint. In no case shall the penalty upon conviction for
violation of a municipal ordinance for toll evasion exceed the limit established in
subsection (3) of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5) (a)  The respective courts of the municipalities, counties, and cities and
counties are given jurisdiction to try all cases arising under municipal ordinances
and state laws governing the use of a toll road or toll highway operated by a toll
road or toll highway company and arising under the toll evasion civil penalty
regulations enacted by a toll road or toll highway company. Venue for such cases
shall be in the municipality, county, or city and county where the alleged violation of
municipal ordinance or state law or of the corporate regulation occurred.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  At the request of the judicial department, a toll road or toll highway
company shall consider establishing an administrative toll enforcement process
and may, by resolution, adopt rules creating such a process. The rules pertaining to
the administrative enforcement of toll evasion shall require notice to the person
cited for toll evasion and provide to the person an opportunity to appear at an open
hearing conducted by an impartial hearing officer and a right to appeal the final
administrative determination of toll evasion to the county court for the county in
which the violation occurred.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  If a toll road or toll highway company establishes an administrative toll
enforcement process, no court of a municipality, county, or city and county shall
have jurisdiction to hear toll evasion cases arising on a public highway operated by
the company.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  A toll evasion case may be adjudicated by an impartial hearing officer in
an administrative hearing conducted pursuant to this section and the rules
promulgated by a toll road or toll highway company. The hearing officer shall be an
independent contractor of the toll road or toll highway company.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  A toll road or toll highway company may file a certified copy of an order
imposing a toll, fee, and civil penalty that is entered by the hearing officer in an
adjudication of a toll evasion with the clerk of the county court in the county in
which the violation occurred at any time after the order is entered. The clerk shall
record the order in the judgment book of the court and enter it in the judgment
docket. The order shall have the effect of a judgment of the county court, and the
court may execute the order as in the other cases.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  An administrative adjudication of a toll evasion by a toll road or toll
highway company is subject to judicial review. The administrative adjudication may
be appealed as to matters of law and fact to the county court for the county in
which the violation occurred. The appeal shall be a review of the record of the
administrative adjudication and not a de novo hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(g)  Notwithstanding the specific remedies provided by this section, a toll
road or toll highway company shall have every remedy available under the law to
enforce unpaid tolls and fees as debts owed to the toll road or toll highway
company.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(6)  The aggregate amount of penalties, exclusive of court costs, collected as
a result of civil penalties imposed pursuant to rules authorized in subsection (3) of
this section shall be remitted to the toll road or toll highway company in whose
name the civil penalty assessment notice was issued and shall be applied by the
company to defray the costs and expenses of enforcing the laws of the state and
the rules of the company. If a municipal summons or complaint is issued, the
aggregate penalty shall be apportioned pursuant to the terms of any enforcement
agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(7) (a)  In addition to the penalty assessment procedure provided for in
subsection (4) of this section, where an instance of toll evasion is evidenced by
automatic vehicle identification photography or other technology not involving a
peace officer, a civil penalty assessment notice may be issued and sent by first-class mail, or by any mail delivery service offered by an entity other than the United
States postal service that is equivalent to or superior to first-class mail with
respect to delivery speed, reliability, and price, by the toll road or toll highway
company to the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved. The notice shall
contain the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle involved, the
license number of the vehicle involved, the time and location of the violation, the
amount of the penalty prescribed for the violation, a place for the registered owner
of the vehicle to execute a signed acknowledgment of liability for the cited
violation, and such other information as may be required by law to constitute the
notice as a complaint to appear for adjudication of a toll evasion civil penalty
assessment. The registered owner of the vehicle involved in a toll evasion shall be
liable for the toll, fee, and civil penalty imposed by the company, except as
otherwise provided by paragraph (b) of this subsection (7).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  In addition to any other liability provided for in this section, the owner of a
motor vehicle who is engaged in the business of leasing or renting motor vehicles is
liable for payment of a toll evasion violation civil penalty; except that, at the
discretion of the owner:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  The owner may obtain payment for a toll evasion violation civil penalty
from the person or company who leased or rented the vehicle at the time of the toll
evasion through a credit or debit card payment and forward the payment on to the
toll road or toll highway company; or</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  The owner may seek to avoid liability for a toll evasion violation civil
penalty if the owner of the leased or rented motor vehicle can furnish sufficient
evidence that, at the time of the toll evasion violation, the vehicle was leased or
rented to another person. To avoid liability for payment, the owner of the motor
vehicle shall, within thirty days after receipt of the notification of the toll evasion
violation, furnish to the toll road or toll highway company an affidavit containing the
name, address, and state driver's license number of the person or company who
leased or rented the vehicle. As a condition to avoid liability for payment of a toll
evasion violation civil penalty, any person or company who leases or rents motor
vehicles to a person shall include a notice in the leasing or rental agreement stating
that, pursuant to the requirements of this section, the person renting or leasing the
vehicle is liable for payment of a toll evasion violation civil penalty incurred on or
after the date the person renting or leasing the vehicle takes possession of the
motor vehicle. The notice shall inform the person renting or leasing the vehicle that
the person's name, address, and state driver's license number shall be furnished to
the toll road or toll highway company when a toll evasion violation civil penalty is
incurred during the term of the lease or rental agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  If the prescribed penalty is not paid within twenty days, in order to ensure
that adequate notice has been given, a toll road or toll highway company shall send
a second penalty assessment notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or
by any mail delivery service offered by an entity other than the United States postal
service that is equivalent to or superior to certified mail, return receipt requested,
with respect to receipt verification and delivery speed, reliability, and price,
containing the same information as is specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection
(7). The notice shall specify that the registered owner of the vehicle may pay the
same penalty assessment at any time prior to the scheduled hearing. If the

report to the department of revenue any outstanding judgment or warrant or any
failure to pay the toll, fee, and civil penalty for any toll evasion. Upon receipt of a
certified report from a court or a toll road or toll highway company stating that the

from a final order entered by the toll road or toll highway company, the department
shall not renew the vehicle registration of the vehicle until the toll, fee, and civil
penalty are paid in full. The toll road or toll highway company shall contract with

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>43-4-217.  Additional funding - road usage fees - rules - legislative
declaration - definitions. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  State motor fuel excise taxes levied on the purchase of motor fuels
represent the largest source of state funding for the construction, maintenance,
and supervision of the highways, roads, and streets of the state;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The amount of motor fuel taxes paid for motor fuel used to propel a
motor vehicle bears a reasonable relationship to the vehicle's use of and impact on
the highways, roads, and streets of the state because the amount of motor fuel
used by a vehicle is in large part a function of the amount of miles traveled by the
vehicle and the weight of the vehicle;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Motor fuel tax rates have not been increased in over twenty-five years,
and motor fuel tax revenue has not kept pace and will not keep pace with inflation
or the increased transportation infrastructure demands of the growing population
of the state because:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  The amount of motor fuel tax paid does not depend on the price of motor
fuel and therefore does not increase when motor fuel prices increase but instead
depends on the quantity of motor fuel purchased, which for most drivers does not
increase over time; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Motor vehicles have become more fuel-efficient over time;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  It is necessary, appropriate, and in the best interest of the state to
mitigate the declining purchasing power of motor fuel excise taxes by collecting a
road usage fee from persons who use the transportation system to travel by motor
vehicle, basing the amount of the fee on reasonable estimates of fee payers' usage
of and impact on the system, and using fee revenue solely for the construction,
maintenance, and supervision of the highways of the state;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  Because motor fuel consumption is reasonably related to use of and
impact on the transportation system, it is fair to fee payers, reasonable, and
appropriate to calculate the amount of the road usage fee based on their motor fuel
consumption;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  It is also fair to fee payers, reasonable, and appropriate to streamline fee
collection by collecting the road usage fee from distributors of motor fuels when
motor fuel taxes are collected because the amount of the fee will be incorporated
into the retail price of motor fuel and therefore passed on to users of the
transportation system in precise proportion to their consumption of motor fuel and
in reasonable relation to their use of and impact on the transportation system; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(g)  In accordance with numerous Colorado judicial precedents, the road
usage fee and the bridge and tunnel impact fee imposed as authorized by section
43-4-805 (5)(g.5) and collected by the department of revenue on behalf of the
statewide bridge and tunnel enterprise pursuant to this section are fees and are not
taxes because:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  The fees are imposed not to raise revenue for general governmental
purposes but instead are imposed for the sole purpose of funding the construction,
maintenance, and supervision of the transportation system, with a priority placed on
projects that are designated as ten-year vision projects on the department's ten-year vision project list;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Fee revenue defrays costs incurred by the state in funding construction,
maintenance, and supervision of the transportation system that is necessitated by
increased use of the system by the fee payers who use motor vehicles on the
transportation system; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  The fees are imposed at rates that are reasonably calculated to defray
the costs of providing the service, are based on the use and impact on the
transportation system by fee payers, and are thus proportional to the benefits
received by fee payers.</SPAN></P>

for which an adjustment to the road usage fee imposed pursuant to subsection (3)

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  In recent years, the number of retail deliveries of tangible personal
property, including restaurant food, has rapidly increased, and this rapid growth is
expected to continue;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The world economic forum estimates that by 2030 there will be over
thirty percent more delivery vehicles on roads to deliver seventy-eight percent
more packages, which will increase usage of the highways, roads, and streets of the
state by motor vehicles used to make retail deliveries, traffic congestion, and retail-delivery-related emissions;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  This additional usage has accelerated and is expected to continue to
accelerate deterioration of surface transportation system infrastructure, and has
required and is expected to continue to require the state, counties, and
municipalities to perform more maintenance and reconstruction of state highways,
county roads, and city streets;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  This additional usage has also increased and is expected to continue to
increase motor-vehicle-related emissions of air pollutants, including ozone
precursors, particulate matter pollutants, other hazardous air pollutants, and
greenhouse gases, that contribute to adverse environmental effects, including but
not limited to climate change, and adverse human health effects;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d.3)  There are administrative costs for a retailer when the state imposes a

subsection (3)(b) of this section is imposed on each retail delivery. Except as
otherwise provided in subsection (6)(b)(II) of this section, for retail deliveries of
tangible personal property purchased during state fiscal year 2022-23, each
retailer who makes a retail delivery shall add to the price of the retail delivery,
collect from the purchaser, and pay to the department of revenue at the time and in
the manner prescribed by the department in accordance with subsection (6) of this
section a retail delivery fee in the amount of eight and four-tenths cents.</SPAN></P>

retail delivery shall add to the price of the retail delivery, collect from the
purchaser, and pay to the department of revenue at the time and in the manner
prescribed by the department in accordance with subsection (6) of this section a
retail delivery fee equal to the amount of the retail delivery fee for retail deliveries
of tangible personal property purchased during the prior state fiscal year adjusted
for inflation. The department of revenue shall annually calculate the inflation
adjusted amount of the retail delivery fee to be imposed on retail deliveries of
tangible personal property purchased during each state fiscal year and shall
publish the amount no later than April 15 of the calendar year in which the state
fiscal year begins.</SPAN></P>

fee for retail deliveries of tangible personal property purchased during a state
fiscal year only if inflation is positive and cumulative inflation from the time of the
last adjustment in the amount of the retail delivery fee, when applied to the sum of
the current retail delivery fee and all current enterprise retail delivery fees and
rounded to the nearest whole cent, will result in an increase of at least one whole
cent in the total amount of the retail delivery fee and all enterprise retail delivery
fees imposed on each retail delivery. The amount of cumulative inflation to be
applied to the sum of the current retail delivery fee and all current enterprise retail
delivery fees and rounded to the nearest whole cent is the lesser of actual
cumulative inflation or five percent.</SPAN></P>

title 39 is exempt from the retail delivery fee and from the enterprise retail delivery
fees.</SPAN></P>

Public Highway Authority Law.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>43-4-502.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly hereby finds,
determines, and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The necessity for this part 5 results from the large population and
population growth within metropolitan regions in the state, from the significant and
growing demand for construction of beltways within such metropolitan regions to
facilitate traffic movement in such metropolitan regions and the inadequacy of
current transportation facilities to meet that demand, from the division of such
metropolitan regions into a variety of incorporated and unincorporated areas, from
the need to coordinate planning and construction of beltways or other
transportation improvements to serve regional needs, and from the limited
availability of state and federal funds for such purposes;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The creation of public highway authorities implements section 18 (2) of
article XIV of the state constitution and is essential to the continued economic
growth of the metropolitan regions of this state, is in the public interest, and will
promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state by securing for
them more adequate transportation;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  It is the intention of the general assembly that public highway authorities
be formed to finance, construct, operate, or maintain all or a portion of a beltway or
other transportation improvements in a metropolitan region which, because of the
cost or the location thereof in the jurisdiction of more than one municipality or
county, cannot feasibly be financed, constructed, operated, or maintained by a
municipality or county acting alone and that it is not the intention of the general
assembly that public highway authorities be formed to assume, directly or
indirectly, the traditional role of counties or municipalities to finance, construct,
operate, or maintain local arterial or collector streets;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  It is the intention of the general assembly that a beltway developed
pursuant to this part 5 shall ultimately be supported by tolls and that, therefore, it
is the intention of the general assembly that revenue-raising powers other than
tolls, granted by this part 5 to authorities, counties, and municipalities, shall be
terminated at such time as the boards of the authorities determine that projected
tolls will be sufficient to meet the authorities' obligations to their bondholders and
to operate and maintain such beltways or other transportation improvements.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  It is further the intent of the general assembly that no provision of this
part 5 affects the former Public School Finance Act of 1973, article 50 of title 22,
the former Public School Finance Act of 1988, article 53 of title 22, the former
Public School Finance Act of 1994, article 54 of title 22, the Public School
Finance Act of 2025, article 54 of title 22, or any additional school financing
mechanisms adopted by the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that it is
the intention of the general assembly that public highway authorities be permitted
to qualify as enterprises under section 20 of article X of the state constitution.
Since the Colorado supreme court in <EM>Nicholl v. E-470 Public Highway Authority</EM>, 896
P.2d 859 (Colo. 1995), determined that the power to impose taxes is inconsistent
with the establishment of a public highway authority as an enterprise under
section 20 of article X of the state constitution, those powers of taxation are hereby
eliminated by S.B. 96-173, as enacted at the second regular session of the sixtieth
general assembly.</SPAN></P>

States postal service that is equivalent to or superior to first-class mail with
respect to delivery speed, reliability, and price, by the public highway authority to
the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved. The notice shall contain the

number of the vehicle involved, the time and location of the violation, the amount of
the penalty prescribed for the violation, a place for the registered owner of the
vehicle to execute a signed acknowledgment of liability for the cited violation, and
such other information as may be required by law to constitute the notice as a
complaint to appear for adjudication of a toll evasion civil penalty assessment. The
registered owner of the vehicle involved in a toll evasion shall be liable for the toll,
fee, and civil penalty imposed by the authority, except as otherwise provided by
paragraph (a.5) of this subsection (6). If the registered owner of the vehicle does
not pay the prescribed toll, fee, and civil penalty within thirty days of the date of the
civil penalty assessment notice, the notice shall constitute a complaint to appear
for adjudication of a toll evasion in court or in an administrative toll enforcement

the registered owner of the vehicle fails to pay in full the outstanding toll, fee, and
civil penalty as set forth in the notice or to appear and answer the complaint and
request a hearing as specified in the notice, a final order of liability shall be entered
against the registered owner of the vehicle for the purposes of enabling the

of subsection (4) of this section.</SPAN></P>

vehicle shall, within thirty days after receipt of the notification of the toll evasion
violation, furnish to the public highway authority an affidavit containing the name,
address, and state driver's license number of the person or company who leased or
rented such vehicle. As a condition to avoid liability for payment of a toll evasion
violation civil penalty, any person or company who leases or rents motor vehicles to
a person shall include a notice in the leasing or rental agreement stating that,
pursuant to the requirements of this section, the person renting or leasing the
vehicle is liable for payment of a toll evasion violation civil penalty incurred on or
after the date the person renting or leasing the vehicle takes possession of the
motor vehicle. The notice shall inform the person renting or leasing the vehicle that
the person's name, address, and state driver's license number shall be furnished to
the public highway authority when a toll evasion violation civil penalty is incurred
during the term of the lease or rental agreement.</SPAN></P>

title 32 or intersects with or is likely to divert vehicle traffic to or from a toll
highway operated by a public highway authority established under part 5 of this
article 4, shall also provide a copy of the contract or resolution to the district or the

the powers of an authority. A transportation planning organization adopting a
resolution authorizing it to exercise the powers of an authority shall also provide a
copy of the resolution for comment to any existing authority that includes or
borders any of the territory in which the transportation planning organization will
exercise the powers of an authority and to the regional transportation district

of the certificate by the director, an authority created by a combination by contract

impact to safe operation of a highway, road, or street, the requesting entity shall
provide, at the time of the request, evidence of the negative impact. The
intergovernmental agreement shall specify whatever terms the combination or

planning, efficient allocation of resources, and equitable sharing of costs. If the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>43-4-701.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly hereby finds
and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The rapid growth of the economy of this state has prompted new and
ever-increasing uses of public highways, roads, and other transportation
infrastructure, and the existing transportation infrastructure of this state cannot
accommodate such greatly increased uses;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  One of the major concerns of the citizens of this state is the ability of the
state and local governments to address the long-term transportation infrastructure
needs of this state that are critical to the continued growth of the state's economy
and the maintenance of citizens' quality of life;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  In an attempt to address this concern, the state has significantly
increased the amount of state revenues available in recent years to fund critical,
priority transportation infrastructure needs, but current transportation funding
mechanisms do not provide adequate revenues to keep pace with the increasing
demands on transportation infrastructure statewide;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  By utilizing revenue anticipation notes for the financing of transportation
projects that may be financed, in whole or in part, with federal transportation funds,
a significant amount of up-front revenues can be generated for such federal aid
transportation projects which will enable the state to design and construct such
transportation projects without using revenues available for other important
transportation projects;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  Utilizing revenue anticipation notes to finance federal aid transportation
projects also results in significant cost savings to the state, since such
transportation projects can be completed at present-day costs and at an
accelerated pace, but the state needs to be able to act quickly to issue revenue
anticipation notes in order to realize these cost savings; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  It is reasonable and necessary to utilize revenue anticipation notes for the
financing of federal aid transportation projects.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  The general assembly further finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The current and long-standing process of funding the transportation
infrastructure needs of the state, which involves the continuous appropriation of
certain state revenues to the department of transportation by the general assembly
and the annual allocation of state and federal funds to specific projects and
purposes by the transportation commission, is intended to ensure that such funding
decisions are based on annual determinations of revenue availability and
transportation infrastructure needs statewide;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Making the payment of revenue anticipation notes issued in accordance
with this part 7 subject to annual allocation by the transportation commission is
equivalent to making such payments subject to annual legislative appropriation,
since the annual allocation process requires the transportation commission to make
the same annual budgeting decisions that the general assembly makes through the
appropriation process;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Revenue anticipation notes issued in accordance with the provisions of
this part 7 that evidence the right to receive payments in subsequent fiscal years
contingent upon funds for such payments being allocated on an annual basis in the
sole discretion of the transportation commission do not constitute a debt by loan in
any form under section 3 of article XI of the state constitution based upon the
Colorado supreme court's decision in <EM>Submission of Interrogatories on House Bill 99-1325</EM>, Case No. 99SA108 (April 23, 1999), since the notes are not a legally
enforceable obligation against the state in future years and the annual allocation of
such funds for the payment of such notes is in the sole discretion of the
transportation commission; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  In accordance with the Colorado supreme court decision in <EM>Submission of
Interrogatories on House Bill 99-1325</EM>, Case No. 99SA108 (April 23, 1999), the
proceeds of any transportation revenue anticipation notes issued in accordance
with this part 7 are not included in state fiscal year spending for purposes of

and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The continued prosperity of the state and its citizens requires a safe,
well-maintained, integrated, multimodal, and sustainable surface transportation
system that is accessible in all parts of the state and that allows efficient
movement of people, goods, and information;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The primary funding sources dedicated for surface transportation, state
and federal motor fuel taxes, are flat rate per gallon taxes that have lost and will
continue to lose much of their purchasing power because they are not indexed to
inflation, have not been increased in nearly two decades, and generate less revenue
per vehicle mile traveled as motor vehicles become more fuel efficient;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Due to the decline in the purchasing power of the revenues generated by
the state and federal motor fuel taxes, the state and local governments have been
unable to maintain, repair, reconstruct, operate, and improve surface transportation
infrastructure in a strategic, timely, and efficient manner, which has already caused
many bridges in the state to become structurally deficient or functionally obsolete
and worsened the condition of road surfaces, delayed capacity expansion projects,
and increased traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Because this decline in purchasing power is ongoing and becomes more
severe with each passing year, the state and local governments will continue to be
unable to maintain, repair, reconstruct, operate, and improve surface transportation
infrastructure in a strategic, timely, and efficient manner, and the safety, efficiency,
and environmental impact of the state's surface transportation system will worsen
more quickly in the future if sufficient and sustainable funding sources for surface
transportation cannot be found.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  The general assembly further finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The national and state economic recession and attendant rise in
unemployment represent additional short- to medium-term challenges for the state
and all Coloradans;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  There is an urgent present need to repair and replace structurally
deficient and functionally obsolete bridges and improve highway safety in the
state;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Increasing funding for designated bridge projects, preventative
maintenance bridge projects, tunnel projects, and road safety projects in the short-
and medium-term through the imposition of bridge and road safety surcharges, a
bridge and tunnel impact fee, and other new fees at rates reasonably calculated
based on the benefits received by the persons paying the fees will not only provide
funding to complete the projects but will also accelerate the state's economic
recovery by increasing bridge, tunnel, and road construction, repair, reconstruction,
and maintenance activity, as well as related economic activity, and by employing
significant numbers of Coloradans;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  The creation of a statewide bridge and tunnel enterprise authorized to
complete designated bridge projects, preventative maintenance bridge projects,

fair and good, and to repair, maintain, and more safely operate tunnels;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  The creation of a high-performance transportation enterprise with the

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  Granting the bridge enterprise and the transportation enterprise both
responsibility for the completion, respectively, of designated bridge projects,

fund designated bridge projects, preventative maintenance bridge projects, tunnel
projects, and highway safety projects and stimulate economic recovery in the short-

sustainable long-term revenue streams dedicated for the construction of important
surface transportation infrastructure projects and the continuing maintenance,
repair, and reconstruction of the statewide surface transportation system that will:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Allow both the state and local governments to maintain, repair,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The specification of additional policies to be considered at all stages of
the statewide transportation planning process and the establishment of an

strategic and that all funding dedicated for surface transportation is expended
effectively.</SPAN></P>

finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The completion of designated bridge projects, preventative maintenance
bridge projects, and tunnel projects is essential to address increasing traffic
congestion and delays, hazards, injuries, and fatalities;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Due to the limited availability of state and federal funding and the need
to accomplish the financing, repair, reconstruction, and replacement of designated
bridges; the completion of preventative maintenance bridge projects; and the
completion of tunnel projects as promptly and efficiently as possible, it is
necessary to create a statewide bridge and tunnel enterprise and to authorize the
enterprise to:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Enter into agreements with the commission or the department to finance,
repair, reconstruct, and replace designated bridges, complete preventative
maintenance bridge projects, and complete tunnel projects in the state; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Impose a bridge safety surcharge, a bridge and tunnel impact fee, and a
bridge and tunnel retail delivery fee at rates reasonably calculated to defray the
costs of completing designated bridge projects, preventative maintenance bridge
projects, and tunnel projects and distribute the burden of defraying the costs in a
manner based on the benefits received by persons paying the fees and using
designated bridges and tunnels and receiving retail deliveries, receive and expend
revenue generated by the surcharge and fees and other money, issue revenue
bonds and other obligations, contract with the state, if required approvals are
obtained, to receive one or more loans of money received by the state under the
terms of one or more financed purchase of an asset or certificate of participation
agreements authorized by this part 8, expend revenue generated by the surcharge
to repay any such loan or loans received, and exercise other powers necessary and
appropriate to carry out its purposes; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  The creation of a statewide bridge and tunnel enterprise is in the public
interest and will promote the health, safety, and welfare of all Coloradans and
visitors to the state by providing bridges and repairing, maintaining, and operating
tunnels in a manner that incorporates the benefits of advanced engineering design,
experience, and safety.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2) (a) (I)  The scope of the existing statewide bridge enterprise created in this
subsection (2)(a)(I) in 2009 is hereby expanded to include designated bridge
projects, preventative maintenance bridge projects, and surface transportation
infrastructure projects for tunnels, and the name of the expanded enterprise is the
statewide bridge and tunnel enterprise. The bridge enterprise is and operates as a
government-owned business within the department. The commission shall serve as
the bridge enterprise board and shall, with the consent of the executive director,
appoint a bridge enterprise director who shall possess such qualifications as may
be established by the commission and the state personnel board. The bridge
enterprise director shall oversee the discharge of all responsibilities of the bridge
enterprise and shall serve at the pleasure of the bridge enterprise board.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  The bridge enterprise and the bridge enterprise director are <STRONG>type 1</STRONG>
entities, as defined in section 24-1-105, and exercise their powers and perform their
duties and functions under the department.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The business purpose of the bridge enterprise is to finance, repair,
reconstruct, and replace any designated bridge in the state, complete preventative
maintenance bridge projects, and complete tunnel projects and, as agreed upon by
the enterprise and the commission, or the department to the extent authorized by
the commission, to maintain the bridges it finances, repairs, reconstructs, and
replaces. To allow the bridge enterprise to accomplish this purpose and fully
exercise its powers and duties through the bridge enterprise board, the bridge
enterprise may:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Impose a bridge safety surcharge, a bridge and tunnel impact fee, and a
bridge and tunnel retail delivery fee as authorized by subsections (5)(g), (5)(g.5),
and (5)(g.7) of this section;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Issue revenue bonds payable from the revenues and other available
money of the bridge enterprise pledged for their payment as authorized in section
43-4-807; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  Contract with any other governmental or nongovernmental source of
funding for loans or grants, including, but not limited to, one or more loans from the
state of money received by the state pursuant to the terms of one or more financed
purchase of an asset or certificate of participation agreements authorized pursuant
to subsection (5)(r) of this section, to be used to support bridge enterprise
functions.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  The bridge enterprise constitutes an enterprise for purposes of section
20 of article X of the state constitution so long as it retains the authority to issue
revenue bonds and receives less than ten percent of its total revenues in grants
from all Colorado state and local governments combined. So long as it constitutes
an enterprise pursuant to this subsection (2)(c), the bridge enterprise shall not be
subject to any provisions of section 20 of article X of the state constitution.
Consistent with the determination of the Colorado supreme court in <EM>Nicholl v. E-470
Public Highway Authority</EM>, 896 P.2d 859 (Colo. 1995), that the power to impose taxes
is inconsistent with enterprise status under section 20 of article X of the state
constitution, the general assembly finds and declares that a bridge safety
surcharge, a bridge and tunnel impact fee, or a bridge and tunnel retail delivery fee
imposed by the bridge enterprise as authorized by subsection (5)(g), (5)(g.5), or
(5)(g.7) of this section is not a tax but is instead a fee imposed by the bridge
enterprise to defray the cost of completing designated bridge projects,
preventative maintenance bridge projects, and tunnel projects that the enterprise
provides as a specific service to the persons upon whom the fee is imposed and at
rates reasonably calculated based on the benefits received by such persons.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3) (a)  The statewide bridge and tunnel enterprise special revenue fund,
referred to in this part 8 as the bridge special fund, is hereby created in the state
treasury. All revenue received by the bridge enterprise, including, but not limited to,
revenue from a bridge safety surcharge imposed as authorized by subsection (5)(g)
of this section, revenue from a bridge and tunnel impact fee imposed as authorized
by subsection (5)(g.5) of this section, revenue from a bridge and tunnel retail
delivery fee imposed as authorized by subsection (5)(g.7) of this section, and any
money loaned to the enterprise by the state pursuant to subsection (5)(r) of this
section, shall be deposited into the bridge special fund. The bridge enterprise board
may establish separate accounts within the bridge special fund as needed in
connection with any specific designated bridge project, preventative maintenance
bridge project, or tunnel project. The bridge enterprise also may deposit or permit
others to deposit other money into the bridge special fund, but in no event may
revenue from any tax otherwise available for general purposes be deposited into
the bridge special fund. The state treasurer, after consulting with the bridge
enterprise board, shall invest any money in the bridge special fund, including any
surplus or reserves, but excluding any proceeds from the sale of bonds or earnings
on such proceeds invested pursuant to section 43-4-807 (2), that are not needed
for immediate use. Such money may be invested in the types of investments
authorized in sections 24-36-109, 24-36-112, and 24-36-113.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  All interest and income derived from the deposit and investment of
money in the bridge special fund shall be credited to the bridge special fund and, if
applicable, to the appropriate designated bridge project account, preventative
maintenance bridge project account, or tunnel project account. Money in the bridge
special fund shall be continuously appropriated to the bridge enterprise for the
purposes set forth in this part 8. All money deposited in the bridge special fund
shall remain in the bridge special fund for the purposes set forth in this part 8, and
no part of the bridge special fund shall be used for any other purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  The bridge enterprise board has exclusive authority to budget and
approve the expenditure of money in the bridge special fund. The bridge enterprise
may expend money in the bridge special fund to pay for:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Bond or loan obligations;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  The administration, planning, financing, repair, reconstruction,
replacement, or maintenance of a designated bridge;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  The completion of preventative maintenance bridge projects;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(IV)  The administration, planning, financing, repair, replacement,
reconstruction, or maintenance of a fair-rated bridge if the repair, replacement, or
reconstruction is included as part of a designated bridge project or other project
involving the repair, replacement, or reconstruction of a designated bridge. A fair-rated bridge may be included in a designated bridge project or other project
involving the repair, replacement, or reconstruction of a designated bridge if
including the fair-rated bridge is an efficient use of the bridge enterprise's
resources and will result in cost savings or schedule acceleration for a project that
will improve safety.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(V)  The completion of tunnel projects;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(VI)  The acquisition of land to the extent required in connection with any

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(VII)  The operating costs and expenses of the bridge enterprise.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  The commission may transfer money from the state highway fund
created in section 43-1-219 to the bridge enterprise for the purpose of defraying
expenses incurred by the enterprise prior to the receipt of bond proceeds or
revenue by the enterprise. The bridge enterprise may accept and expend any
money so transferred, and, notwithstanding any state fiscal rule or generally
accepted accounting principle that could otherwise be interpreted to require a
contrary conclusion, such a transfer shall constitute a loan from the commission to
the bridge enterprise and shall not be considered a grant for purposes of section 20
(2)(d) of article X of the state constitution. As the bridge enterprise receives
sufficient revenues in excess of expenses, the enterprise shall reimburse the state
highway fund for the principal amount of any loan from the state highway fund
made by the commission plus interest at a rate set by the commission. Any money
loaned from the state highway fund to the bridge enterprise pursuant to this
section shall be deposited into a fund to be known as the statewide bridge and
tunnel enterprise operating fund, which fund is hereby created, and shall not be
deposited into the bridge special fund. Money from the bridge special fund may,
however, be used to reimburse the state highway fund for the amount of any loan
from the state highway fund or any interest thereon.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  In addition to any other powers and duties specified in this section, the

tear on and increase the reliability, safety, and expected useful life of state
highways and bridges, reduce traffic congestion and attendant delays, provide
additional transportation options, reduce emissions from air pollutants and
greenhouse gas pollutants from motor vehicles, and reduce the adverse
environmental and health impacts of such emissions; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  By providing services as authorized by this part 8, the transportation
enterprise engages in an activity conducted in the pursuit of a benefit, gain, or
livelihood and generates revenue by collecting fees from services users, and
therefore operates as a business in accordance with the determination of the
Colorado supreme court in <EM>Nicholl v. E-470 Public Highway Authority</EM>, 896 P.2d 859
(Colo. 1995), and the Colorado court of appeals in <EM>TABOR Foundation v. Colorado

of the state constitution and the determination of the Colorado supreme court in
<EM>Colorado Union of Taxpayers Foundation v. City of Aspen</EM>, 2018 CO 36, that a charge
is not a tax if the primary purpose of the charge is not to raise revenue for general
governmental purposes, it is the conclusion of the general assembly that the
revenue collected by the transportation enterprise from user fees is generated by
fees, not taxes, because the user fees imposed by the transportation enterprise:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Are imposed for the specific purpose of allowing the transportation
enterprise to defray the costs of completing, operating, and maintaining the surface

All revenue received by the transportation enterprise, including all revenue from
both user fees collected from users of a particular surface transportation
infrastructure project and congestion impact fees, collected pursuant to
subsections (2)(c)(I) and (7.6) of this section, must be deposited into the
transportation special fund. The transportation enterprise board may establish
separate accounts within the transportation special fund as needed in connection
with any specific surface transportation infrastructure project. The transportation
enterprise also may deposit or permit others to deposit other money into the
transportation special fund, but in no event may revenue from any tax otherwise
available for general purposes be deposited into the transportation special fund.
The state treasurer, after consulting with the transportation enterprise board, shall
invest any money in the transportation special fund, including any surplus or
reserves, but excluding any proceeds from the sale of bonds or earnings on such
proceeds invested pursuant to section 43-4-807 (2), that are not needed for
immediate use. Such money may be invested in the types of investments authorized

special fund to pay bond obligations, to fund surface transportation infrastructure
projects, and for the acquisition of land to the extent required in connection with
any surface transportation infrastructure project. The transportation enterprise
may also expend moneys in the transportation special fund to pay its operating
costs and expenses. The transportation enterprise board shall have exclusive
authority to budget and approve the expenditure of moneys in the transportation

bond proceeds or revenues by the enterprise. The transportation enterprise may
accept and expend any moneys so transferred, and, notwithstanding any state
fiscal rule or generally accepted accounting principle that could otherwise be
interpreted to require a contrary conclusion, such a transfer shall constitute a loan
from the commission to the transportation enterprise and shall not be considered a
grant for purposes of section 20 (2)(d) of article X of the state constitution. As the
transportation enterprise receives sufficient revenues in excess of expenditures,
the enterprise shall reimburse the state highway fund for the principal amount of
any loan made by the commission plus interest at a rate set by the commission. Any
moneys loaned to the transportation enterprise pursuant to this section shall be
deposited into a fund to be known as the statewide transportation enterprise
operating fund, which fund is hereby created, or an account within the

project, or as a portion of the expenditures made for another surface transportation
infrastructure project that is integrated with the project as part of a surface
transportation system; except that the transportation enterprise board may expend
user fee revenue from each surface transportation infrastructure project in
proportion to the total amount of such revenue generated by the project to pay
overhead of the transportation enterprise. User fee revenue generated by the
congestion impact fee imposed by the transportation enterprise pursuant to
subsection (7.6) of this section may be expended on any part of the surface

the best interests of the state for the transportation enterprise to purchase or lease
the toll highway or a partial interest in the toll highway that is being offered for
sale, lease, or concession or enter into a public-private partnership in connection
with the toll highway. In evaluating a toll highway, the transportation enterprise
board shall consider the financial costs and benefits to the state and users of the
toll highway of purchasing or leasing the toll highway or a partial interest in the toll
highway or entering into a public-private partnership in connection with the toll

thirty days.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The congestion impact fee must be collected, submitted to the
department of revenue, administered by the department of revenue, and forwarded

the daily vehicle rental fee imposed pursuant to section 43-4-804 (1)(b)(I)(A) is
collected, submitted, administered, and forwarded pursuant to section 43-4-804
(1)(b)(II). The department of revenue, when forwarding the congestion impact fee to
the state treasurer with the daily vehicle rental fee imposed pursuant to section 43-4-804 (1)(b)(I)(A), shall identify the amounts of each fee being forwarded, and the
state treasurer shall credit all congestion impact fees to the transportation special
fund. Any vehicle rented pursuant to a vehicle sharing arrangement that is exempt,
pursuant to section 43-4-804 (1)(b)(III), from the daily vehicle rental fee imposed
pursuant to section 43-4-804 (1)(b)(I)(A) is also exempt from the congestion impact
fee.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c) (I)  For short-term vehicle rentals beginning during state fiscal year 2026-27 and for short-term vehicle rental periods beginning during any subsequent state
fiscal year, the daily limits on the amount of the congestion impact fee set forth in
subsection (7.6)(a)(I) of this section are annually adjusted for inflation, and the
transportation enterprise shall impose the congestion impact fee in a maximum
amount that is the maximum amount for the prior state fiscal year adjusted for
inflation. The transportation enterprise shall notify the department of revenue of
the amount of the congestion impact fee to be collected for short-term vehicle
rentals during each state fiscal year no later than April 1 of the calendar year in
which the state fiscal year begins, and the department of revenue shall publish the
amount no later than May 1 of the calendar year in which the state fiscal year
begins.</SPAN></P>

amount of revenue generated by the fee, and the use of fee revenue in order to
ensure that it is continuing to impose the fee at rates that are reasonably
calculated to generate only the amount of revenue needed to pay the overall costs
of providing the services to fee payers that will be funded with that revenue. If the
transportation enterprise determines that it is imposing or with its next inflation
adjustment will be imposing the fee at a rate that generates or will generate more
than the needed amount of revenue, it shall lower the rate at which it is imposing
the fee or forego or reduce the inflation adjustment to the extent necessary to
ensure that it is continuing to impose the fee at rates that are reasonably

municipal summons or complaint is issued, the aggregate penalty shall be
apportioned pursuant to the terms of any enforcement agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f) (I)  In addition to the penalty assessment procedure provided for in
paragraph (c) of this subsection (2), where an instance of toll evasion is evidenced
by automatic vehicle identification photography or other technology not involving a
peace officer, a civil penalty assessment notice may be issued and sent by first-class mail, or by any mail delivery service offered by an entity other than the United
States postal service that is equivalent to or superior to first-class mail with
respect to delivery speed, reliability, and price, by the transportation enterprise to
the registered owner of the motor vehicle involved. The notice shall contain the
name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle involved, the license
number of the vehicle involved, the date of the notice, the date, time, and location
of the violation, the amount of the penalty prescribed for the violation, a place for
such person to execute a signed acknowledgment of liability for the cited violation,

Except as otherwise provided in subparagraphs (II) and (III) of this paragraph (f), the
registered owner of the vehicle involved in a toll evasion shall be presumed liable
for the toll, fee, or civil penalty imposed by the transportation enterprise. If the
registered owner of the vehicle does not pay the prescribed toll, fee, or civil penalty
within thirty days of the date of the civil penalty assessment notice, the notice shall
constitute a complaint to appear for adjudication of a toll evasion in court or in an
administrative toll enforcement proceeding, and the registered owner of the vehicle
shall, within the time specified in the notice, file an answer to the complaint in the
manner specified in the notice. If the registered owner of the vehicle fails to pay in
full the outstanding toll, fee, or civil penalty as set forth in the notice or to appear
and answer the complaint and request a hearing as specified in the notice, a final
order of liability shall be entered against the registered owner of the vehicle for the
purposes of enabling the registered owner to appeal pursuant to subparagraph (VI)
of paragraph (d) of this subsection (2) and allowing the transportation enterprise to
proceed to judgment pursuant to subparagraph (V) of paragraph (d) of this
subsection (2).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(A)  The owner may obtain payment for a toll evasion violation civil penalty
from the person or company who leased or rented the vehicle at the time of the toll
evasion through a credit or debit card payment and forward the payment to the
transportation enterprise; or</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(B)  The owner may seek to avoid liability for a toll evasion violation civil
penalty if the owner of the leased or rented motor vehicle can furnish sufficient
evidence that, at the time of the toll evasion violation, the vehicle was leased or
rented to another person. To avoid liability for payment, the owner of the motor
vehicle shall, within thirty days after receipt of the notification of the toll evasion
violation, furnish to the transportation enterprise an affidavit containing the name,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>43-4-1201.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly hereby finds
and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Retail deliveries are increasing and are expected to continue to increase
in communities across the state;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The motor vehicles used to make retail deliveries are some of the most
polluting vehicles on the road, which has resulted in additional and increasing air
and greenhouse gas pollution;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  The adverse environmental and health impacts of increased emissions
from motor vehicles used to make retail deliveries can be mitigated and offset by
supporting the widespread adoption of electric buses for transit fleets and
reducing vehicle miles traveled by encouraging people to choose clean, efficient,
public transit options instead of personal motor vehicle travel;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  Instead of reducing the impacts of retail deliveries by limiting retail
delivery activity through regulation, it is more appropriate to continue to allow
persons who receive retail deliveries to benefit from the convenience afforded by
unfettered retail deliveries and instead impose a small fee on each retail delivery
and use fee revenue to fund necessary mitigation activities;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  It is necessary, appropriate, and in the best interest of the state and all
Coloradans to incentivize, support, and accelerate the electrification of public
transit in rural and urban areas throughout the state because electrification:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Reduces emissions of air pollutants, including hazardous air pollutants
and greenhouse gases, that contribute to adverse environmental effects, including
but not limited to climate change, and adverse human health effects in and
between communities, including communities near high-use transit corridors and
disproportionately impacted communities, and helps the state meet its statutory
greenhouse gas pollution reduction targets and comply with air quality attainment
standards; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  By reducing fuel and maintenance costs associated with the use of motor
vehicles, helps public transit providers operate more efficiently, use cost savings to
provide more reliable and convenient transit service to more riders, and further
reduce emissions by reducing personal motor vehicle use; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  By reducing motor vehicle emissions, transit fleet electrification
effectively remediates some of the impacts of retail deliveries by offsetting a
portion of the increased motor vehicle emissions resulting from such deliveries.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(1.5)  The general assembly further finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Scientific and government agency studies, including the national climate
assessment and the Colorado Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction Roadmap,
published by the Colorado energy office and dated January 14, 2021, confirm that oil
and gas operations can create significant environmental and other adverse impacts,
including greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change and
emissions of local air pollutants that are ozone precursors;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  According to modeling conducted by the division of administration in the
department of public health and environment in 2023, oil and gas development is
the leading anthropogenic source of ozone precursors in Colorado's ozone
nonattainment areas and is responsible for forty-one percent of volatile organic
compound emissions and forty-five percent of nitrogen oxide emissions;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  The adverse impacts of oil and gas production affect both urban and rural
communities, justifying investment in transit service improvements in communities
across the state to reduce local pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions and
benefit disproportionately impacted communities;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  The oil and gas industry is the third-largest source of greenhouse gas
emissions in the state;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  In the 2019 legislative session, the general assembly passed House Bill
19-1261, which recognized that climate change adversely affects Colorado's
economy, air quality, public health, ecosystems, natural resources, and quality of
life and set science-based goals of reducing statewide greenhouse gas pollution,
from 2005 levels, by twenty-six percent by 2025, fifty percent by 2030, and ninety
percent by 2050. Through Senate Bill 23-016, enacted in 2023, the general
assembly updated these goals to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by
2050 with interim reduction goals of sixty-five percent by 2035, seventy-five
percent by 2040, and ninety percent by 2045, measured against 2005 statewide
greenhouse gas pollution levels.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  According to the Colorado Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction
Roadmap 2.0, published by the Colorado energy office in February 2024, current
policy and future commitments through 2026 alone are unlikely to achieve the
state's 2025 and 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction goals without further
actions to reduce emissions associated with transportation, and the roadmap's list
of near-term actions necessary to meet those goals includes policies and programs
that expand and increase public transit service, passenger rail service, and
ridership;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(g)  Reducing vehicle trips by encouraging the use of public transit helps to
lower ozone-forming and greenhouse gas emissions. According to An Update on
Public Transportation's Impacts on Greenhouse Gas Emissions, published by the
national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine in 2021, Colorado transit
agencies operating in Denver, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and Pueblo
collectively reduced six hundred twenty-four thousand nine hundred forty-two
metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(h)  Policy directive 1610.0, published by the Colorado department of
transportation and effective May 19, 2022, estimates twenty-three metric tons of
greenhouse gas emission reductions for every one thousand additional vehicle-revenue-hours of new transit service delivered by a zero-emission vehicle and
eighteen metric tons for every one thousand additional vehicle-revenue-hours of
new transit service delivered by a diesel-powered vehicle;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(i)  According to the Zero Fare for Better Air 2023 Evaluation Report,
published by the regional transportation district on November 30, 2023, the two-month zero fare for better air program resulted in a twelve percent increase in
ridership and a total reduction of nine million fourteen thousand three hundred
seventy vehicle miles traveled, two thousand five hundred eighty-three pounds of
volatile organic compounds, two thousand three hundred eighty-five pounds of
nitrous oxides, and six million one hundred sixty-one thousand seven hundred
seventy-two pounds of greenhouse gas emissions, which demonstrates a direct
relationship between increased transit ridership and reduced air pollution and
greenhouse gas emissions;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(j)  Numerous studies have found that, in addition to the direct impact on
pollution due to replacing individual vehicle trips with trips on transit, there are
large additional impacts that come from the indirect effect that transit has on
enabling more dense land use near transit stops and stations, which reduces trip
lengths and increases the share of trips taken by walking, bicycling, and using
transit. For example, An Update on Public Transit's Impacts on Greenhouse Gas
Emissions, published in 2021 by the national academies of sciences, engineering,
and medicine, found that the indirect impacts of transit increased the emission
reductions by an amount more than seven times larger than the direct reductions.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(k)  To mitigate some of the adverse environmental and health impacts of air
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions caused by oil and gas operations, it is
necessary, appropriate, equitable, and in the best interest of all Coloradans to
impose fees on oil and gas produced in the state.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  The general assembly further finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  In order to incentivize, support, and accelerate the electrification and
availability of public transit and thereby reap the environmental, health, business,
and operational efficiency benefits of electrification and wider availability of public
transit, it is necessary, appropriate, and in the best interest of the state to create a
clean transit enterprise that can provide specialized remediation and other services
that help public transit providers fund the construction of the charging
infrastructure needed to support electrification, the acquisition of electric motor
vehicles, and the remediation services described in section 43-4-1204;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The specific focus of the enterprise is the equitable reduction and
mitigation of the adverse environmental and health impacts of air pollution and
greenhouse gas emissions through incentivization, support, and acceleration of the
electrification of public transit in rural and urban areas throughout the state and
through the implementation of the remediation services described in section 43-4-1204;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  The enterprise provides impact remediation services when, in exchange
for the payment of clean transit retail delivery fees by or on behalf of purchasers of
tangible personal property for retail delivery, it acts to mitigate the impacts of
residential and commercial deliveries on the state's transportation infrastructure,
air quality, and emissions by:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Making grants or loans or providing rebates to fund the acquisition of
clean, quiet, and cost-efficient electric motor vehicles for use in transit fleets and
the construction of charging infrastructure that supports the use of such electric
motor vehicles for public transit and thereby:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(A)  Improving transportation options for fee payers and the general public,
making transit more attractive to new or infrequent users, and reducing personal
motor vehicle emissions; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(B)  By making transit more attractive, reducing traffic congestion, which
allows more timely and efficient retail deliveries, further reduces emissions of air
pollutants and greenhouse gas pollutants from motor vehicles, and reduces and
mitigates the adverse environmental and health impacts of such emissions;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Contributing in a unique and targeted way to the implementation of the
comprehensive regulatory scheme required for the planning, funding, development,
construction, maintenance, and supervision of a sustainable transportation system;
and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(III)  Providing additional remediation services to offset impacts caused by
fee payers as may be provided by law;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c.5)  The enterprise provides the remediation services described in section
43-4-1204 in exchange for payment of the production fees for clean transit, which
are used to partially mitigate the impacts of oil and gas operations on the
environment through the implementation of actions related to public transit,
including investment in public transit to achieve the level of frequent, convenient,
and reliable transit that is known to increase transit ridership by replacing car trips
with bus and rail trips;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  By providing remediation services as authorized by this section, the clean
transit enterprise engages in an activity conducted in the pursuit of a benefit, gain,
or livelihood and therefore operates as a business in accordance with the
determination of the Colorado supreme court in <EM>Colorado Union of Taxpayers
Foundation v. City of Aspen,</EM> 2018 CO 36;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(e)  Consistent with the determination of the Colorado supreme court in
<EM>Nicholl v. E-470 Public Highway Authority</EM>, 896 P.2d 859 (Colo. 1995), that the power
to impose taxes is inconsistent with enterprise status under section 20 of article X
of the state constitution, it is the conclusion of the general assembly that the
revenue collected by the enterprise is generated by fees, not taxes, because the
clean transit retail delivery fee imposed by the enterprise as authorized by section
43-4-1203 (7) and the production fee for clean transit are:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Imposed for the specific purpose of allowing the enterprise to defray the
costs of providing the remediation services specified in this section, including
mitigating impacts to air quality and greenhouse gas emissions caused by the
activities on which the fee is assessed, and contributes to the implementation of the
comprehensive regulatory scheme required for the planning, funding, development,
construction, maintenance, and supervision of a sustainable transportation system
specified in this section; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Collected at rates that are reasonably calculated based on the impacts
caused by fee payers and the cost of remediating those impacts;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(f)  So long as the enterprise qualifies as an enterprise for purposes of
section 20 of article X of the state constitution, the revenue from the clean transit
retail delivery fee collected by the enterprise is not state fiscal year spending, as
defined in section 24-77-102 (17), or state revenues, as defined in section 24-77-103.6 (6)(c), and does not count against either the state fiscal year spending limit
imposed by section 20 of article X of the state constitution or the excess state
revenues cap, as defined in section 24-77-103.6 (6)(b)(I)(D); and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(g)  The addition of the production fee for clean transit continues to serve the
enterprise's primary business purposes set forth in section 43-4-1203 (3)(a). If the
addition of the production fee for clean transit combined with the clean transit
retail delivery fee is estimated to result in the collection of fees and surcharges
that exceed one hundred million dollars in the enterprise's first five fiscal years, the
board shall adjust the fees, lower the fees, or stop collecting the fees in order to
not collect fees or surcharges that exceed one hundred million dollars in the
enterprise's first five fiscal years, which five-year period, for the purpose of section
24-77-108, ends on June 30, 2026. Therefore, the enterprise, originally created in
section 43-4-1203, is in compliance with section 24-77-108.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Reduce and mitigate the adverse environmental and health impacts of air

retail deliveries by supporting the replacement of existing gasoline and diesel
transit vehicles with electric motor vehicles, including motor vehicles that originally
were powered exclusively by internal combustion engines but have been converted
into electric motor vehicles; providing the associated charging infrastructure for
electric transit fleet motor vehicles; supporting facility modifications that allow for
the safe operation and maintenance of electric transit motor vehicles; and funding
planning studies that enable transit agencies to plan for transit vehicle
electrification; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Reduce and mitigate the adverse environmental and health impacts of air
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions produced by oil and gas development by
investing in public transit, including vehicles, infrastructure, equipment, materials,
supplies, maintenance, and operations and staffing, to achieve the level of frequent,
convenient, and reliable transit that is known to increase ridership by replacing car
trips with bus and rail trips and forms of transit known to support denser land use
patterns that further reduce pollution due to shorter trip lengths and greater
walking and cycling mode share.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  To allow the enterprise to accomplish the business purposes described in
subsection (3)(a) of this section and fully exercise its powers and duties through the
board, the enterprise may:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Impose a clean transit retail delivery fee as authorized by subsection (7) of

article X of the state constitution so long as it retains the authority to issue revenue
bonds and receives less than ten percent of its total annual revenue in grants from
all Colorado state and local governments combined. So long as it constitutes an
enterprise pursuant to this subsection (4), the enterprise is not subject to section 20
of article X of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

be credited to the fund, and any other money that the general assembly may
appropriate or transfer to the fund. The state treasurer shall credit all interest and

state constitution, for the supervision of the public highways of this state. The
enterprise may accept and expend any money so transferred, and, notwithstanding
any state fiscal rule or generally accepted accounting principle that could
otherwise be interpreted to require a contrary conclusion, such a transfer is a loan
from the commission to the enterprise that is required to be repaid and is not a
grant for purposes of section 20 (2)(d) of article X of the state constitution or as
defined in section 24-77-102 (7). All money transferred as a loan to the enterprise
shall be credited to the clean transit enterprise initial expenses fund, which is
hereby created in the state treasury, and loan liabilities that are recorded in the
fund but that are not required to be paid in the current fiscal year shall not be
considered when calculating sufficient statutory fund balance for purposes of
section 24-75-109. The state treasurer shall credit all interest and income derived
from the deposit and investment of money in the clean transit enterprise initial
expenses fund to the fund. The clean transit enterprise initial expenses fund is
continuously appropriated to the enterprise for the purpose of defraying expenses
incurred by the enterprise before it receives fee revenue or revenue bond proceeds.

shall reimburse the state highway fund for the principal amount of any loan made
by the commission plus interest at a rate set by the commission.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>Cross references:</STRONG> For the legislative declaration in SB 21-260, see section 1
of chapter 250, Session Laws of Colorado 2021.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>43-4-1301.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>(1)  The general assembly hereby finds
and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Rapid and continuing growth in retail deliveries made by motor vehicles
and in prearranged rides arranged through transportation network companies has
increased and will continue to increase traffic congestion and air pollution from
motor vehicle emissions, along with the adverse environmental and health impacts
that result from such pollution, in nonattainment areas, including but not limited to
disproportionately impacted communities and communities adjacent to highways;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  It is necessary and appropriate to offset and mitigate these impacts by
creating a nonattainment area air pollution mitigation enterprise that has the
business purpose of providing funding for eligible projects that reduce traffic
congestion, including demand management projects that encourage alternatives to
driving alone, and thereby reduce travel delays, engine idle time, and unproductive
fuel consumption or that directly reduce emissions by means such as retrofitting of
construction equipment;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Instead of reducing the impacts of retail deliveries and prearranged rides
arranged through transportation network companies, by limiting retail delivery and
prearranged ride activity through regulation, it is more appropriate to continue to
allow persons who receive retail deliveries and benefit from the convenience
afforded by unfettered retail deliveries and to allow transportation network
companies that arrange prearranged rides to continue to provide that service
without undue restrictions and to instead impose a small fee on each retail delivery
and prearranged ride and use fee revenue to fund necessary mitigation activities.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  The general assembly further finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The enterprise provides impact remediation services when, in exchange
for the payment of air pollution mitigation per ride fees by transportation network
companies and air pollution mitigation retail delivery fees by or on behalf of
purchasers of tangible personal property for retail delivery, it acts as authorized by
this section to mitigate the impacts of prearranged rides arranged through
transportation network companies and residential and commercial deliveries on the
state's transportation infrastructure, air quality, and emissions;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  By providing impact remediation services as authorized by this section,
the nonattainment area air pollution mitigation enterprise provides a benefit to fee
payers when it remediates the impacts they cause and therefore operates as a
business in accordance with the determination of the Colorado supreme court in
<EM>Colorado Union of Taxpayers Foundation v. City of Aspen,</EM> 2018 CO 36;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Consistent with the determination of the Colorado supreme court in
<EM>Nicholl v. E-470 Public Highway Authority</EM>, 896 P.2d 859 (Colo. 1995), that the power
to impose taxes is inconsistent with enterprise status under section 20 of article X
of the state constitution, it is the conclusion of the general assembly that the
revenue collected by the enterprise is generated by fees, not taxes, because the air
pollution mitigation per ride fee and the air pollution mitigation retail delivery fee
imposed by the enterprise as authorized by section 43-4-1303 are:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Imposed for the specific purpose of allowing the enterprise to defray the
costs of providing the remediation services specified in this section, including
mitigating impacts to air quality and greenhouse gas emissions caused by the
activities on which the fees are assessed, and contribute to the implementation of
the comprehensive regulatory scheme required for the planning, funding,
development, construction, maintenance, and supervision of a sustainable
transportation system; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Collected at rates that are reasonably calculated based on the impacts
caused by fee payers and the cost of remediating those impacts; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(d)  So long as the enterprise qualifies as an enterprise for purposes of
section 20 of article X of the state constitution, the revenue from the community
access retail delivery fee collected by the enterprise is not state fiscal year
spending, as defined in section 24-77-102 (17), or state revenues, as defined in
section 24-77-103.6 (6)(c), and does not count against either the state fiscal year
spending limit imposed by section 20 of article X of the state constitution or the
excess state revenues cap, as defined in section 24-77-103.6 (6)(b)(I)(D).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Five members appointed by the governor with the consent of the senate
as follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  The business purpose of the enterprise is to mitigate the environmental
and health impacts of increased air pollution from motor vehicle emissions in
nonattainment areas that results from the rapid and continuing growth in retail
deliveries made by motor vehicles and in prearranged rides provided by
transportation network companies by providing funding for eligible projects that
reduce traffic, including demand management projects that encourage alternatives
to driving alone or that directly reduce air pollution, such as retrofitting of
construction equipment, construction of roadside vegetation barriers, and planting
trees along medians. To allow the enterprise to accomplish this purpose and fully
exercise its powers and duties through the board, the enterprise may:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Impose an air pollution mitigation per ride fee and an air pollution
mitigation retail delivery fee as authorized by subsections (7) and (8) of this section;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Issue grants, loans, and rebates as authorized by subsection (9) of this
section; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(c)  Issue revenue bonds payable from the revenue and other available money
of the enterprise.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(4)  The enterprise constitutes an enterprise for purposes of section 20 of
article X of the state constitution so long as it retains the authority to issue revenue
bonds and receives less than ten percent of its total annual revenue in grants from
all Colorado state and local governments combined. So long as it constitutes an
enterprise pursuant to this subsection (4), the enterprise is not subject to section 20
of article X of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5) (a)  The nonattainment area air pollution mitigation enterprise fund is
hereby created in the state treasury. The fund consists of air pollution mitigation
per ride fee revenue and air pollution mitigation retail delivery fee revenue credited
to the fund pursuant to subsections (7) and (8) of this section, any monetary gifts,
grants, donations, or other payments received by the enterprise, any federal money
that may be credited to the fund, and any other money that the general assembly
may appropriate or transfer to the fund. The state treasurer shall credit all interest
and income derived from the deposit and investment of money in the fund to the
fund. Money in the fund is continuously appropriated to the enterprise for the
purposes set forth in this part 13 and to pay the enterprise's reasonable and
necessary operating expenses, including the repayment of any loan received
pursuant to subsection (5)(b) of this section.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The department may transfer money from any legally available source to
the enterprise for the purpose of defraying expenses incurred by the enterprise
before it receives fee revenue or revenue bond proceeds. The enterprise may
accept and expend any money so transferred, and, notwithstanding any state fiscal
rule or generally accepted accounting principle that could otherwise be interpreted
to require a contrary conclusion, such a transfer is a loan from the department to
the enterprise that is required to be repaid and is not a grant for purposes of
section 20 (2)(d) of article X of the state constitution or as defined in section 24-77-102 (7). All money transferred as a loan to the enterprise shall be credited to the
nonattainment area air pollution mitigation enterprise initial expenses fund, which
is hereby created in the state treasury, and loan liabilities that are recorded in the
nonattainment area air pollution mitigation enterprise initial expenses fund but that
are not required to be paid in the current fiscal year shall not be considered when
calculating sufficient statutory fund balance for purposes of section 24-75-109.
The state treasurer shall credit all interest and income derived from the deposit and
investment of money in the nonattainment area air pollution mitigation enterprise
initial expenses fund to the fund. The nonattainment area air pollution mitigation
enterprise initial expenses fund is continuously appropriated to the enterprise for
the purpose of defraying expenses incurred by the enterprise before it receives fee
revenue or revenue bond proceeds. As the enterprise receives sufficient revenue in
excess of expenses, the enterprise shall reimburse the department for the principal
amount of any loan made by the department plus interest at a rate set by the
department.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>43-4-1501.  Legislative declaration. </STRONG>(1) (a) (I)  The general assembly finds and
declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(A)  Certain communities in the state serve as the distribution points for
almost all of the fuel transported in the state;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(B)  Licensed fuel distributors rely on the hazardous mitigation corridor
infrastructure in these communities to support the economic functions of the state;
and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(C)  Increasing requirements on fuel composition and blends will cause the
infrastructure in these communities to be relied upon even more.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(II)  Therefore, the general assembly finds that it is appropriate to establish
the fuels impact reduction grant program to provide grants to those communities
for the improvement of their hazardous mitigation corridor infrastructure and for
projects related to the transportation of fuel within the state.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Therefore, the general assembly finds that it is reasonable to establish
the fuels impact enterprise to assist in the administration of the programs
described in this subsection (1) and to collect the fees necessary to implement
these programs.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  The general assembly further finds and declares that:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  The fuels impact enterprise provides impact reduction services when, in
exchange for the payment of the fuels impact reduction fee by licensed fuel excise
tax distributors and licensed fuel distributors, it acts as authorized by this section
to provide assistance in improving hazardous mitigation corridors and projects
related to the transportation of fuel within the state;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  By providing impact reduction services as authorized by this section, the
fuels impact enterprise provides a benefit to fee payers by improving the
transportation of fuel in the state and monitoring vehicle emissions and, therefore,
operates as a business in accordance with the determination of the Colorado
supreme court in <EM>Colorado Union of Taxpayers Foundation v. City of Aspen</EM>, 2018 CO

<EM>Nicholl v. E-470 Public Highway Authority</EM>, 896 P.2d 859 (Colo. 1995), the power to
impose taxes is inconsistent with enterprise status under section 20 of article X of
the state constitution, and, therefore, it is the conclusion of the general assembly
that the revenue collected by the fuels impact enterprise is generated by fees, not
taxes, because the fuels impact reduction fee imposed by the enterprise is:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(I)  Imposed for the specific purpose of allowing the enterprise to defray the

or state revenues, as defined in section 24-77-103.6 (6)(c), and does not count
against either the state fiscal year spending limit imposed by section 20 of article X
