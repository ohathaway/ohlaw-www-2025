<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  The state public defender shall make the determination of indigency,
subject to review by the court. When a defendant or, if applicable, the defendant's
parent or legal guardian requests representation by a public defender, such person
shall submit an appropriate application, the form of which states that the
application is signed under oath and under the penalty of perjury and that a false
statement may be prosecuted as such. The applicant shall pay a nonrefundable
processing fee of twenty-five dollars if the court-appointed counsel enters an
appearance based upon the application; except that a person under the jurisdiction
of the juvenile court, as defined in section 19-1-103, or the person's parent,
guardian, or legal custodian is not required to pay the processing fee. The fee is
assessed at the time of sentencing, if sentencing occurs, or upon other final
disposition of the case; except that the court may, at sentencing or other final
disposition, waive the fee if the court determines, based upon the financial
information submitted by the party being represented by the court-appointed
counsel, that the person does not have the financial resources to pay the fee.
Before the court appoints a public defender based on said application, the court
shall advise the defendant or, if applicable, the defendant's parent or legal
guardian that the application is signed under oath and under the penalty of perjury.
A copy of the application must be sent to the prosecuting attorney for review, and,
upon request, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue of the eligibility for
appointment of the public defender's office. Processing fees collected pursuant to
this subsection (3) are transmitted to the state treasurer, who shall credit the same
to the general fund.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(5)  Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent the public defender,
before determining indigency, from providing representation to juveniles in
detention hearings.</SPAN></P>

On and after January 1, 1997, the office of alternate defense counsel shall contract,
where feasible, without prior approval of the court, for the provision of attorney
services for cases described in section 21-2-103 (1). To provide for adequate legal
representation of persons who are indigent, the office of alternate defense counsel
may contract, where feasible, without prior approval of the court, for the provision
of necessary legal services commensurate with those available to persons who are
not indigent for cases described in section 21-1-103 (1). The office of alternate
defense counsel shall establish, where feasible, a list of approved contract
attorneys to serve as counsel and a list of approved legal services providers to
provide services in such cases. As a condition of placement on the approved list, the
contracting attorney or legal services provider shall agree to provide services
based on the terms to be established in a contract, at either a fixed fee established
by the office of alternate defense counsel or the hourly rate for reimbursement set
by the supreme court. Terms of the contract must be negotiated between the
alternate defense counsel and the contract attorney or legal services provider.
Contracts made pursuant to this section must specify that the services must be
provided subject to the Colorado rules of professional conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2) (a)  Contracts made pursuant to this section must provide for reasonable
compensation and reimbursement for expenses necessarily incurred, to be fixed
and paid from state funds appropriated therefor. The office of alternate defense
counsel shall review the bills submitted for reimbursement by any contractor and
may approve or deny the payment of such bills in whole or in part based on the
terms set forth in the contract negotiated between the alternate defense counsel
and the contractor.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  The rate contracted for attorney time pursuant to subsection (2)(a) of this
section for fiscal year 2023-24 is one hundred dollars per hour for cases involving a
type B felony as referenced in attachment D to chief justice directive 04-04 and as
modified by the gradations found in attachment D to chief justice directive 04-04.
That hourly rate must be increased annually by no more than five dollars each year
until the hourly rate is at least seventy-five percent of the rate set pursuant to the
federal Criminal Justice Act Revision of 1986, 18 U.S.C. sec. 3006A, as amended,
for indigent representation in federal court. That hourly rate may be adjusted in
subsequent fiscal years to maintain the hourly rate at or above seventy-five percent
of the rate set pursuant to the federal Criminal Justice Act Revision of 1986, 18
U.S.C. sec. 3006A, as amended, for indigent representation in federal court.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  Colorado relies primarily on an independent contractor model of legal
representation for court-appointed adult and youth representation in accordance
with this section when the public defender's office has a legal conflict of interest.
While the office of the alternate defense counsel provides some legal
representation for indigent individuals on some cases through state employees and
will continue to explore the use of state employee staff model solutions where
feasible, Colorado's need for conflict-free indigent defense counsel cannot be filled
or provided statewide by direct employees of the office of the alternate defense
counsel. For the purpose of determining eligibility for federal public service loan
forgiveness, any independent contractor, including, but not limited to, a resource
advocate, an investigator, a case assistant, an attorney, a social worker, a paralegal,
or a legal researcher, who is currently providing or has previously provided legal
services or services through an interdisciplinary legal team has a conflict in
providing these services as a state employee. The director of the office of the
alternate defense counsel or the director's designee is authorized to sign a
certification for any current or past independent contractor that certifies that the
contractor appears to be eligible for federal public service loan forgiveness as
allowed by federal law or regulations. With the authorization of an independent
contractor, the director of the office of the alternate defense counsel or the
director's designee may share information, including the contractor's name, social
security number or federal employer identification number, and the total number of
hours billed by the contractor by calendar year, with other independent judicial
agencies for the purpose of certifying apparent past, current, and future eligibility
for public service loan forgiveness allowed by federal law or regulations.</SPAN></P>
