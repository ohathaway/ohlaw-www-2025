the governing instrument or in any other law of this state, and except as otherwise
provided by court decree entered on or after June 2, 1971, the following acts shall
be prohibited:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Engaging in any act of self-dealing, as defined in section 4941 (d) of the
federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which would give rise to any liability for
the tax imposed by section 4941 (a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986;</SPAN></P>

imposed by section 4944 (a) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and</SPAN></P>

may, without application to any court and either before or after the funding of such

(e), 664, 2055 (e), and 2522 (c) of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to
the extent applicable, by executing a written amendment to the trust for that
purpose. Consent shall not be required as to individual beneficiaries not living at the
time of amendment or as to charitable beneficiaries not named or not in existence
at the time of amendment. The possibility of beneficial interests arising after the
amendment of the governing instruments shall not defeat the ability to amend. In
the case of an individual beneficiary not competent to give consent, the consent of
such beneficiary's guardian or conservator, if any, or the consent of a guardian ad
litem appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction is treated as the consent of the
beneficiary. A copy of the proposed amendment, executed by the trustee and
consented to by all beneficiaries whose consent is required under this subsection
(3), must be delivered in person or by registered mail to the attorney general. The
attorney general may, within sixty days after such receipt, indicate by registered
mail to the trustee his or her specific objections to such proposed amendment, in
which event the provisions of subsection (4) of this section apply if he or she does
not withdraw his or her objections. In the case of any amendment to a trust created

upon petition of the trustee or any beneficiary and upon a subsequent finding by
the court that the testator's or the grantor's intention would not be defeated by
such amendment. A copy of such petition shall be delivered in person or by
registered mail to the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	<STRONG>15-1.2-201.  Fiduciary duties - general principles. </STRONG>(1)  In making an allocation
or determination or exercising discretion under this article 1.2, a fiduciary shall:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Act in good faith, based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Administer a trust or estate impartially, except to the extent the terms of
the trust manifest an intent that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more
beneficiaries;</SPAN></P>

even if there is a different provision in this article 1.2; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(2)  A fiduciary's allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under
this article 1.2 is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary
may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the
terms of the trust, and an exercise of the power which produces a result different
from a result required or permitted by this article 1.2 does not create an inference
that the fiduciary abused the fiduciary's discretion.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(3)  A fiduciary shall:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(a)  Add a receipt to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor
this article 1.2 allocates the receipt between income and principal; and</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(b)  Charge a disbursement to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the
trust nor this article 1.2 allocates the disbursement between income and principal.</SPAN></P>

convert an income trust to a unitrust under section 15-1.2-303 (1)(a), change the

(1)(b), or convert a unitrust to an income trust under section 15-1.2-303 (1)(c), if the
fiduciary determines the exercise of the power will assist the fiduciary to
administer the trust or estate impartially.</SPAN></P>

determined by the fiduciary;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Public Sans">	(h)  Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the fiduciary
power to accumulate income or invade principal or prohibit the fiduciary from

emergency exists because a fiduciary's actions or omissions pose an imminent risk
of substantial harm to a ward's or protected person's health, safety, or welfare or to
the financial interests of an estate, the court may, on its own motion or upon the
request of an interested person, without a hearing and without following any of the
procedures authorized by section 15-10-502, order the immediate restraint,
restriction, or suspension of the powers of the fiduciary; direct the fiduciary to
appear before the court; or take such further action as the court deems appropriate
to protect the ward or protected person or the assets of the estate. If a court
restrains, restricts, or suspends the powers of a fiduciary, the court shall set a
hearing and direct that notice be given pursuant to section 15-10-505. The clerk of
the court shall immediately note the restraint, restriction, or suspension on the
fiduciary's letters, if any. Any action for the removal, surcharge, or sanction of a
fiduciary shall be governed by this section. The court shall rule on its motion or the

it appears to the court that, in the absence of such an order, the fiduciary may take
some action that would unreasonably jeopardize the interest of the petitioner or of
some other interested person. The court may make persons with whom the fiduciary
may transact business parties to any order issued pursuant to this paragraph (b).
The restraint shall be endorsed upon the fiduciary's letters, if any.</SPAN></P>
