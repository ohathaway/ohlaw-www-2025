      <p class="mb-6">
        By using this website, you agree to these Terms of Use. Think of this as our agreement about how things work around here.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">The Golden Rule</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">

      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Prohibited Practices</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        While we're pretty permissive about most things, here are the specific activities that cross the line:

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Credit Considerations</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        If you use our content elsewhere, please give us credit - we appreciate it and it's the right thing to do. We're fine with competitors and anyone else using our content, but attribution matters.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Attorney-Client Clarification</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        This is important enough to say twice: reading something on this website does not mean you have an attorney representing you and giving you legal advice. We will always send an engagement letter to anyone who becomes our client. That letter is the only way we agree to represent you. Ever.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Data Details</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        When you fill out forms, take quizzes, or provide contact information, we handle that data according to our Privacy Policy. The short version: we use it to help you and we don't sell it to anyone.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Linked Locations</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        We sometimes link to other websites, including our payment processor and scheduling system. Those sites have their own rules and we're not responsible for what happens there. Use your judgment.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Disclaimers and Disclaimers</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        We do our best to keep this website running smoothly and provide accurate information, but we can't guarantee everything will be perfect all the time. Sometimes technology acts up, and sometimes humans make mistakes. We're not liable for damages that might result from using this site.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Colorado Control</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        These Terms of Use are governed by Colorado law, because that's where we practice and where our website lives.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Modification Mentions</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        As our website grows and changes, we might need to update these terms. If we make significant changes, we'll let you know by posting the new terms here and updating the date below.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Questions?</h2>
