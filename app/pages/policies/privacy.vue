      <p class="mb-6">
        <span class="italic">Business Associate Agreement (BA Agreement).</span> A Business Associate Agreement is a formal written contract between OHLaw and a HIPAA Covered Entity or Business Associate that requires OHLaw to comply with specific requirements related to protected health information (PHI).
        <br /><span class="italic">Covered Entity.</span> A Covered Entity is a health plan, health care provider, or healthcare clearinghouse that must comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
        <br /><span class="italic">Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</span> PII includes all information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, etc.

We may use or disclose PHI on behalf of, or to provide services to, Covered Entities for purposes of fulfilling our service obligations to Covered Entities, if such use or disclosure of PHI is permitted or required by the BA Agreement and would not violate the Privacy Rule.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">
        In the event that PHI must be disclosed to a subcontractor or agent, we will ensure that the subcontractor or agent agrees to abide by the same restrictions and conditions that apply to us under the BA Agreement with respect to PHI, including the implementation of reasonable and appropriate safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Safeguards</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        We use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of PII including those provided for in the various BA Agreements. We have implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the electronic PII that we create, receive, maintain, or.

      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-700 mt-8 mb-4">Mitigation of Harm</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">In the event of a use or disclosure of PII that is in violation of this policy, the requirements of a BA agreement, or other law, we will mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect resulting from the violation. Such mitigation will include:</p>
